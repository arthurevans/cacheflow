&lt;i&gt;intr.v.&lt;/i&gt; lurked, lurk·ing, lurks&lt;br /&gt;
1. To hide in a dark place with evil intent.&lt;br /&gt;
2. To hang around while waiting, waiting, waiting...&lt;br /&gt;
3. To read but not contribute to an online geocaching forum.&lt;br /&gt;
[Middle English: lurken or louren (meaning lower)]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is located within a few feet of the sidewalk and
parking. No need to cross fences into Buddhist or Water Department
lands (stay off those private properties).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when you find this lurking cache, be sure to follow
good geocaching practice and replace it as found.&lt;/p&gt;

Trying to sign one of these with a full log, in the dark, with a flashlight that requires holding the button down was more of a challenge than finding the cache.  The log is completely full -- I was barely able to find room for an 'RR'.  While I was in the process of putting this back a young couple started heading my way.  I made sure to make noise so they realized it wasn't a good idea to head for this corner to do whatever it was they wanted to do.  TFTP&amp;C</groundspeak:text>

I had previously tried to look for this little guy many times before before but always found tons of muggles right at the GZ. Clearly, the tea leaves had to be consulted! After much tea-drinking and worshipping, the solution appeared to me in a tea-filled maze, er, I mean haze. Early mornings!!! Popped along this morning just after 6am and quickly picked up the cache. Amazingly, there was one muggle there even at this early point of the day. I managed to avoid his attention while searching for and signing the log. Back to bed for me! TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;According to the web site &lt;a href=
"http://www.vta.org/highways/rte85101n.htm"&gt;http://www.vta.org/highways/rte85101n.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Mainline weaving operations” refers to the competing
movements of cars trying to enter and exit the freeway on the same
stretch of roadway. This project will separate these traffic
movements by modifying interchange ramps, constructing a new
freeway-to-freeway connector and adding special auxiliary lanes to
provide additional room for motorists entering or exiting the
freeway.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This highway improvement project is supposed to be finished in
early 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Waypoint 1:&lt;/b&gt; The posted coordinates. Take a moment to look
east and see how much progress has been made since I placed the
cache. Find the pole nearby and observe that it is labeled with a
series of digits and letters arranged in a vertical column, as
follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font face="courier"&gt;DIGIT = A&lt;br&gt;
LETTER&lt;br&gt;
DIGIT = B&lt;br&gt;
DIGIT = C&lt;br&gt;
DIGIT = D&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look straight up and observe a two-digit number. Let
      &lt;font face="courier"&gt;E&lt;/font&gt; = the smaller of these digits
      and let &lt;font face="courier"&gt;F&lt;/font&gt; = the larger of these
      digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Waypoint 2:&lt;/b&gt; Walk 180 feet true south from waypoint
1.&amp;nbsp; Find the writing on the concrete wall nearby.&amp;nbsp;
Underneath the words “&lt;font face="courier"&gt;NORTH-SHORELINE BLVD
O.C.&lt;/font&gt;” there are five digits, arranged as &lt;font face=
"courier"&gt;GH-IJK&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compute the digits of the final coordinates as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font face="courier"&gt;T = A - I + F&lt;br&gt;
U = B + G - K&lt;br&gt;
V = C + I - E&lt;br&gt;
X = D - A + E&lt;br&gt;
Y = F + G + I&lt;br&gt;
Z = H + J - A&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font face="courier"&gt;N 37° 24.TUV W 122°
04.XYZ&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a little over a mile walk from the posted
coordinates. As you approach, you can enjoy viewing the interchange
project from a different angle. I particularly like the
artistically embellished concrete facade. Bring something to write
with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;June 9, 2006 — I should have hidden an ammo
box here, but I was just a newbie and I was dying to hide this cute
bison tube I had, so that’s what you have to find. Sorry. And the
high tension wires overhead seem to mess up people’s reception, so
you really have to work to get a handle on ground zero. Sorry
again. The hide is kind of clever, though. &lt;b&gt;Do not go into the
blackberry or poison oak bushes; the cache is not
there.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I have started on this multi several times but was never able to locate the final as it appeared to be missing on past attempts.  Recently I noted that it had been replaced so Friday I stopped by to get the coords at the first stage yet again and today my wife and I decided to go out for a hike around the baylands area and began our hike near the coords for the final. It was a relatively quick grab once I reached GZ.  The multi points out an intersection that was sorely needed as the valley grew. I drove a delivery truck back in the early 80s while in college and I can still remember what a nighmare this area was prior to the new construction.  It was a long time in coming.

I slogged through figuring out who had solved all of the puzzle and came up with one than one person. I was stumped until I got a nudge from Storyhaven and then I was stumped until I made some kind of odd leap of logic and figured out what I needed to do to solve the puzzle...I was so proud of myself.

We  pull up and is usually the case I was scoping things out and Janet is in there finding the cache. Stunning as usual, to me at least. Good hide and a fun puzzle.

&lt;p&gt;John W. Whisman (b. 1810) was a pioneer stage coach line
operator after whom the Whisman school district was named.&amp;nbsp;
Originally formed in 1869, the Whisman school district was merged
in 2001 with the Mountain View school district.&amp;nbsp; The Whisman
name appears on a number of other local public works including a
school, a park, a street, and the nearby sports center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a whimsically camoed peanut butter jar, initially
filled mainly with various trinkets I have collected from other
caches.&amp;nbsp; Crittenden School is located on the other side of the
baseball field, so muggles may be expected at certain times of the
day.&amp;nbsp; The original contents of the original cache were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;whistle&lt;br&gt;
BADGES button&lt;br&gt;
ladybug magnet&lt;br&gt;
soccer coin&lt;br&gt;
Sacagawea dollar coin&lt;br&gt;
Dave Matthews Band carabiner&lt;br&gt;
silver-colored necklace&lt;br&gt;
logbook with pencil&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;October 7, 2005.&amp;nbsp; The original cache was
lost when its hiding place was obliterated.&amp;nbsp; I located a
similar place nearby and hid a similar replacement cache
there.&amp;nbsp; The posted coordinates have been updated.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;July 1, 2006.&amp;nbsp; The replacement cache
disappeared.&amp;nbsp; I constructed a second replacement cache and hid
it in the same place.&amp;nbsp; Since people who are looking in exactly
the right place are having trouble finding the cache, I raised the
difficulty to 1.5 stars.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;September 13, 2006.&amp;nbsp; The second
replacement cache was lost when its hiding place was
obliterated.&amp;nbsp; Sigh.&amp;nbsp; I located a similar place nearby and
hid the third replacement cache there.&amp;nbsp; The posted coordinates
have been updated.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;May 24, 2007.&amp;nbsp; The third replacement
cache was lost when its hiding place was obliterated.&amp;nbsp;
Sigh.&amp;nbsp; Again.&amp;nbsp; Given the effort put out by the forces of
chaos to extirpate whatever hiding place this cache happens to
occupy, I was tempted to transfer the cache into a stand of poison
oak.&amp;nbsp; But that would be too whimsical, so I restrained
myself.&amp;nbsp; Instead, I located a reasonably similar hiding place
nearby and hid the fourth replacement cache there.&amp;nbsp; The posted
coordinates have been updated.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;November 30, 2007.&amp;nbsp; The fourth
replacement cache disappeared.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps that hiding place was
a little too exposed.&amp;nbsp; I found a slightly more concealed
hiding place a few feet away and hid the fifth replacement cache
there.&amp;nbsp; The posted coordinates have been updated.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;April 16, 2008.&amp;nbsp; The fifth replacement
cache disappeared, presumably by falling off into the ivy, and I
hate ivy.&amp;nbsp; Okay, that place definitely did not work.&amp;nbsp;
Let's go back to a hanging hide, perhaps the fence?&amp;nbsp; Moved a
few feet away and hid the sixth replacement cache there.&amp;nbsp; The
posted coordinates have been updated.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I always appreciate an easy puzzle, and when I find a good one
that is far away, I often think there should be one like it around
here. So I'm starting my "Stolen Puzzles" series. Hopefully, I'll
find a bunch more easy ones to duplicate and make it a real
series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is taken after a puzzle I found up in Oregon called
Shady Characters. The container is a key hider with enough room for
a small log and some tiny trade items. Please bring your own pen.
And the cache is not located at the posted coordinates, but is
within a mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A sprinkling of evil near a convoluted trail.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I love this trail which twists, dives, and climbs to prevent pedestrians from mixing with cars on two busy ramps between Shoreline Blvd and Central Expressway. I rarely take this trail but when I do, I enjoy how I sometimes become a little directionally disoriented as the trail seems to go all over the place with the surrounding roads going everywhere else. If you need to cross Central Expressway in search of the many nearby caches on either side, this trail is useful to know about.

This micro cache is located near this trail but is at least 10 meters from any pavement, so PLEASE STAY OFF ANY ROADS IN THE AREA. You'll find this cache at or below the level of the nearest pavement, so focus your attention low, very low, even lower. Do not dig because digging cannot access it. Don't bother to sweep aside leaves or needles because it's not buried under those things. Don't disassemble any lamps, grates, sprinklers, meter boxes, or electrical boxes.  You should be able to find this cache without disrupting the grounds, plants, or equipment that are in the area. Just lift the cache from its hiding place (that is the ONLY way you can get it).

The numerous trees in the area are likely to disrupt your GPS reception of satellite signals. I got the coordinates by approaching from various angles then confirmed the coordinates (as always) with GoogleEarth because I know that some new cachers use that tool before investing in a GPS unit.

WARNING: If you look at the wrong time (especially if you are caching in a dishonorable or disruptive way), you'll likely meet the nasty wrath of one or more of the nearby sprinkler demons who occasionally douse the whole area without warning. Don't say that you were not warned!

TIP: Bring a pen to sign the log. This micro cache is too small for pens and trade items though it is starting with a micro pencil).

ANOTHER TIP: Drive-by cachers can get easy access to this cache by parking at N37 23.911 W122 04.840.  Within 10 meters of this location you'll see access to the trail through an opening (a gate) in a chain-linked fence. From that point on, you'll never need to walk on a motorway to access this cache.

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I was recently browsing through a box of old books at a garage sale when I came across a copy of "Baseball’s 100 Greatest Players”. The editors of “The Sporting News" had put their heads together and came up with this list, which they published in book form, full of info on each player and big glossy photographs. The book was in pretty good shape, with no torn pages or marks except for one thing. On the page that listed all the top 100 players in order, someone had taken a red magic marker and boldly written, "Dream Team" at the top. The following names on the list had been circled with a red marker as well:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Pitching: Sandy Koufax&lt;br /&gt;
Catcher: Yogi Berra&lt;br /&gt;
First Base: Willie McCovey&lt;br /&gt;
Second Base: Joe Morgan&lt;br /&gt;
Third Base: Wade Boggs&lt;br /&gt;
Shortstop: Ozzie Smith&lt;br /&gt;
Center Field: "The Yankee Clipper", Joe DiMaggio&lt;br /&gt;
Left Field: "Shoeless" Joe Jackson&lt;br /&gt;
Right Field: "Wee" Willie Keeler&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition, I discovered the following message scribbled on a post-it note that had been stuck in the book, perhaps to mark the page with the “Dream Team” selections. I asked the owner of the garage sale what it meant, but he told me he had no idea. He wasn't even sure where that book had come from, and speculated that perhaps it had belonged to his father, who had passed away many years prior.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;The note:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">When this was first puzzled I had no idea how to get started, and just didn't have the patience I used to for taking stabs in the dark.  Once a little more help was added, it turned out I really enjoyed working through this one.  Coming back in the daylight made all the difference.  Initially I was expecting something else but closely related, and once I found this (quite easily this time) I realized how it can be much more difficult in the dark.  I really enjoyed the puzzle and the nicely crafted container, definitely worth a favorite point.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;Calculate that f(0) = 3 and f(1) = 11. Now you figure out
diff1(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;) for x = 0 which is calculated where diff1(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;)
= (f(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;+1) - f(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;) for a value of 8. Now you do the
same type of cascading subtractions for x = 2. So f(2) = 25 and
diff1(1) = 25 - 11 = 14. And diff2(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;) for x = 0 is
calculated with diff2(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;) = (diff1(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;+1) -
diff1(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;) for a value of 6 (14 - 8). Now here comes the cool
part. To find the solution for &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 3, you don't have to do
any multiplication. You just add 6 + 14 + 25 for a value of 45
which is the solution for f(3). Figure out the diff1 of 20 and
diff2 of 6 and you'll be able to compute f(4) with only addition.
The equation is now f(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;) = f(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;-1) + diff1(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;-2)
+ diff2(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;-3). You'll note that the diff2 column always has
the same value. And as you add higher order polynomial functions,
you'll need more columns and more diff fuctions (like diff3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you understand how the difference engine calculates
polynomial functions, you can try out different values for
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; below until you figure out the
coordinates of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

4&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; +
6&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

3&lt;var&gt;w&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + 4&lt;var&gt;w&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; +

I sure wish that the finders would consider checking the "Favorites" box as they log their caches.  With all the many favorite votes we have to assign, I'm sure that more than 3 people of the 55 finders, thought that this was good enough to assign one of their favorite votes!!!! Hey, Mr. CO, If I could assign more than one, this cache would definitely get more than one from me!!!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">As Paracelsus mentioned .... I am not a math geek, like Paracelsus.  I think that's what drew me to him back in 1969, when we first started dating!!! (I really needed help with my Physics homework!).  So, I looked at this one, and thought ... Maybe??? Well, maybe not!!! I thought I understood what to do, but realized I was way out of my league!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
But I was still intrigued!  So, I saved it to my bookmark list for today's Geocaching trip.  I mean, it's close to the Jasmer Challenge cache, so we've GOT to find it, if he can solve it.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Needless to say, as soon as he saw it, he had it solved ... I mean, WITHIN MINUTES!!!  I hate that! (Not Really)  Actually, I'm impressed  that the problem means something to someone!!!!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, today's trip HAD to include this one! Even if it was getting late!!! I mean all the caches we found today were between &lt;b&gt;[blue]53 and 90 crow-fly miles[/blue]&lt;/b&gt; miles from home!!!! And we know how Crow-fly miles don't really indicate the work done to achieve the 11 finds.... We probably hiked about 6 miles to get the 4 early Jasmer-Challenge 2000-2001 caches.  

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I digress! I must say, that when Paracelsus explained how he did it, I though that seems logical! But that still doesn't mean I'd know how to do it myself.  I seem to recall a "Far Side" cartoon from years back about "Hell's Library!" that really fits for me!</groundspeak:text>

We grabbed some other nearby caches too, and this was one of them. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While planning our trip, Mama discovered this one. But, mathematics not being her forte, she gladly turned it over to the numbers and math geek in the family, yours truly! I had it solved in short order the night before, and we were ready to make the grab today. For what it's worth: (1) The "Difference algorithm" is "kewl", but I knew a &lt;i&gt;much quicker&lt;/i&gt; way (easier AND &lt;i&gt;faster&lt;/i&gt; than &lt;i&gt;Excel&lt;/i&gt;) to solve it, and will provide a &lt;u&gt;nudge&lt;/u&gt;, NOT a giveaway, to anyone (like the non-math types) who e-mails me for that. And (2) I am, as I said, a bit of a "numbers and math geek" myself, so if you are too, or just want a "different" slant on Geocaching, look up caches I have hidden in the Sacramento area, especially the ones that feature different concepts based on math and numbers. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As for this cache, it was fun to do, educational, and easily earns a Favorite from another "numbers and math geek!" SL, TFTC, and thanks for the fun!</groundspeak:text>

as portrayed in &lt;i&gt;The Wizard of OZ&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wicked&lt;/i&gt;. Instead,
she melted away to a quiet but wicked retirement in Mountain View,
CA where she'd be far from her goody-two-shoes college roommate,
Glenda, and the "little Kansas snot" named Dorothy. If you have the
stomach for her wickedness, you're welcome to visit her at her very
modest home (a large micro), which was built in her image and is
guarded where few would care to venture. She's happily hidden where
she can quietly haunt Sierra Vista Park, especially at 10 PM (fall
and winter) or 11 PM (Spring and Summer) when she lets out her
water demons to play in the dark. No need to climb anything,
trespass private property, or squeeze where no mere muggle can
squeeze. Your stealth is greatly appreciated by her and her
unsuspecting neighbors. BYOQ (bring your own quill)!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

find the actual coordinates of the cache, you must solve the
following puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This puzzle is anything but child's play, but I remember working
on it when I was 12 or 13 years old. I cannot remember if I ever
solved it then or at any other time in my life, so I gave it a try
and spent an hour solving it. Not bad for someone with a college
degree in a history. If I can solve it, so can you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a micro that is carefully hidden where playing
children are not likely to find it. To find it, you'll need to use
the digits found in the following cryptogram multiplication problem
to determine the coordinates of the cache. Each letter represents a
different digit between 0 and 9 inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

F=

determine the following coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;

W122 05.FRO
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you arrive at the location, do not look on the fence. The

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The coordinates are to a telephone outside of a business's lobby.
Pick up the phone and when prompted say "Audio Cache".</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="top"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is on the business's property but the exact location
of the cache container is discovered by picking up the phone just
"outside" the lobby. When prompted, say "Audio Cache". You will
then be connected to a friendly IVR (interactive voice recognition)
application which will tell you the exact location of the cache.
The directions are somewhat complex. You may want to take notes as
you are listening to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will also let you listen to other people's audio logs and let
you leave an audio log if you so desire. If you do want to leave an
audio log, stay on the phone long enough to confirm the log you
just recorded meets your approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A note about security: the cache is on private property but you
have permission to be there. Not only does my management know about
the "audio cache" project but they encouraged me to create it. On
the rare occasion someone asks and you do not feel like explaining
what geocaching is and what the phone has to do with it, simply
state you are visiting David Sweet. Thats me and I am employed at
the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Although the IVR is intuitive these are the steps:
1. pick up phone
1a. you may need to tap the cradle to get a dialtone
2. say "Audio Cache" when prompted
3. then say something like "location" at the next prompt

Take a ride on the light rail. &amp;nbsp; These caches have been
designed to get you out of your auto and spend some time on public
transportation, but you do not need to ride on the light rail to
find them. &amp;nbsp; Each of the sixteen caches has been placed near
stations along the &lt;a href=

on its own, but you'll need to find the first sixteen caches in
order to obtain the coordinates for the seventeenth cache. &amp;nbsp;
The log for each cache, except one, includes a numerical value or
code word that is used to figure out the final coordinates for the
seventeenth cache.

Cache is magnetic. &amp;nbsp; Even if you believe that you'll never try
to find the seventeenth cache you should write down the code word
and the station it was found at just in case you change your mind.
&amp;nbsp; Please make a note in your remarks if you traveled to these
caches by light rail shuttle. &amp;nbsp; Thanks for your visit.

1.	I have very short lunch breaks.
2.	I’m a tight wad.

SO, I figured out a few ways to help get through these challenges.

There is frequently an orange Checker (no releation to frivlas and OAP) Cab convention in next parking lot around lunch time. Use stealth as needed.  

Coords should get you within 10 feet of cache. Feel free to post better cords if ya get ‘em. 

Original cache:
Camo decon container (I really like those!)
Log sheet
Few tokens
$5 card for lunch

The counter-espionage agent, who went without a name, returned from
the cocktail party dressed in an impeccable suit and with his face
beet-red.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Agent, report!" said his superior, who was also nameless (names
being a liability in his business).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Sir. I was unable to determine the dead drop location, sir. I got
as close to Agent Hsiao as I could, but the music was so loud, and
everyone was shouting at each other. Even when I was able to catch
her voice for a moment, I'm not even sure what language she was
speaking! It didn't sound like Mandarin..."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The superior's expression didn't change noticeably, but his silence
spoke volumes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"...I did have five bugs placed strategically around the room. I'm
&lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; they must have picked up something!"&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The superior's glower faded as he listened to the tapes. "All right
agent, you did your best. But if we don't stop Hsiao's plans within
72 hours, she will release the giant death kittens upon our
helpless city. What do we do? &lt;strong&gt;What do we

But thanks to what I've learned from the CO's Programming Challenge Puzzle Series, I was able to stand on the shoulders of intellectual giants and put the pieces together to solve this one.  Wow, that was interesting, mind-bending, and reminded me of how little I really know.  Thanks for another excellent challenge.  Left our token.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="True">[Excellent work, and outstanding puzzle!  Certainly earns its near 100% favorite rating.  Solved it awhile back, but made time to pick it up on the way to the redwoods.]  At first I thought it was muggled, because about 110 feet away from the coordinates was a decon container marked "Official Geocache Please Do Not Disturb" just sitting on top of a utility box in plain view.  (I sent a photo to the cache owner).  [Anyway, TFTP/C!]

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was a very interesting puzzle.   I posted a link to it on the Tri-valley Geocaching facebook page and Team Yofa and Fizzymagic reported it solved not long after.  Feeling left behind I asked Team Klinward if he wanted to work on it together.  After a careful listen to the microphones I had a good idea of what I needed to do but I wasn't sure how to go about doing it.   So I ran my theory past Team Yofa and he pointed me at the technology that would enable me to find what I seek.  After overcoming some gaps in my snake charming skills I finally managed to get the data in desired.  However it wasn't entirely what I expected.  After a little more research and manipulation I had it.   Then I passed the acquired data to Team Klinward so he could make the final discovery for himself too.   

I had lunch with the CO today and decided that I should stop and grab this one on the way back to the office.   Very cool puzzle.  Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Second find of the day and year.  I'd like to say that this was a real team effort between mcdurr, galadril and myself, but I can't.  When mcdurr pinged me about teaming up on this one, I was all for it!!!  I would have never gotten it if he hadn't helped.  Once coding/scripting enters this picture, I'm pretty much out.  mcdurr did the hard part, and sent me a recording of a voice speaking a foreign language.  After a quick translation, I alas had coords in hand.  A few weeks have passed since then, but with nothing else to do today, The Boss, mini-cachers and I all decided it was time to take this one off the list.  Great hide spot, sturdy cache container.  Our mini-cachers LOVED the swag, so we traded a bit.  Thanks for the fun adventure!

We found two possible solution directions, and we solved it both ways.  Very neat puzzle; I really liked it.  I guessed well for the final position and it was the first spot I looked!</groundspeak:text>

Let's face it, the Favorites system has been a mixed blessing for
puzzle hiders. On the one hand, when one of your puzzles gets a
Favorite point, it can really make your day. On the other hand,
releasing a puzzle that doesn't get any points can make you feel
sad. Frustrated. Vulnerable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That's why I created the &lt;a href=
"http://mjtokelly.webfactional.com/vulnerability/"&gt;Vulnerability
Project&lt;/a&gt;. You may not have any Favorite points to give (or maybe
you don't like my puzzles at all &lt;img src=

words of kindness to help get me through the day. I sure will
appreciate it!&lt;br /&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Poor bunny, needs hugs.  I tried. I really did. For ever so long. But that bunny just wouldn't let me close enough to hug it.  I pleaded and cajoled, praised and flattered, used every kind word that I knew but none of them brought me any closer.  Finally, a random conversation with a geofriend gave me encouragement and a hint on how to get started.  I made a little progress but still no hugs. [:(] This puzzle was really out of my realm of knowledge.  A little more education from another geofriend opened my eyes to the potentiality of what I had been doing. A little more flattering and I made it past step one.  Cool! Look what I found. Maybe that bunny will let me give it a hug now?  Oh no....I barely touched its whisker and was stopped by the invisible barrier again.  I was so close. I could feel it.  Tried this that and the other but couldn't make the final step. [xx(]  After another couple of weeks, I went back to my geofriend for another hint and discovered that I was only one character away from a solution. So close yet so far.  I plugged it all in and saw just what I was looking for.  Hooray shouted the bunny and allowed me to give it a huge hug! (I hope there is some stuffing left in it).  So, Mr. Mokelly, I must say that you are VERY clever although also a little evil [}:)]  Thanks for giving me an education!</groundspeak:text>

What I can say is that one doesn't actually solve it but rather one submits an endless sequence of requests, questions, comments, notes, equations, random thoughts, offers of money and disparate pleas while trying to remain sane.   Sensing that I might be going insane I brought puzzle to the attention of a couple of my associates to take a fresh look at it.  Naturally, they had it solved in a few hours.  And yes, I had spent many hours beating on it since it was published.

Once I did, I stumbled into what I needed to do, and it was fun to proceed along, even without knowing whether I was really on the right path for a while. Decided to grab this cache tonight when my brain wasn't really functioning. First, I drove to the posted coordinates. Then, I passed up much better parking to find parking that involved a longer and muddier walk. I was surprised when the path I was on suddenly ended because my misreading of the satellite map had indicated I would be crossing a river (if my brain had been working, I might have questioned what river would be here). I found the honey trap and stabbed myself in the knee simultaneously, then considered giving up on the cache before spotting it in a place I should have looked at sooner.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Northern California version of "The Jasmer
Challenge". You must have logged at least one cache that was placed
in every month back to the start of Geocaching (May 2000).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to log this cache, you need to provide the GC code of a
cache that was placed in each month for all of 2000 and 2001 in
your log entry. Of course, you have to have a find for caches
placed in all other months (up to and including the current month)
as well, but those tend to be easier to come by and don't require
as much verification. You are also encouraged to run the &lt;a href=
"http://gsak.net/board/index.php?showtopic=10281"&gt;MonthlyCoverage
GSAK macro&lt;/a&gt; that sums this all up and post a screen grab of the
output in the Gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of my progress towards logging this
cache:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=
"margin: 10px 0pt 10px 5px; padding: 0pt; float: right; width: 100%;"&gt;

title="Click to view full size" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also encourage others to create similar "Jasmer Challenge"
caches in their own state. (No more than one per major metropolitan
area please.)&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We signed the log a few weeks ago, and since have traveled to Utah for that final cache to complete the N. California Edition of the Jasmer Challenge.  In addition to signing the log at that final cache, we traveled into a couple of other states we have not been to.  Our journey did not net us a whole bunch of caches, that was not our goal, but it did get us the important ones we looked for.
Utah is a very diverse state as far as the terrain.  The most impressive area is the Manti-La Sal National Forest.  It is unspeakably beautiful and we so enjoyed our travels through it.  Completing this challenge has taken us to many interesting places we may have never gone to.  
Thanks for the challenge.</groundspeak:text>

Yea, it was fun but we also helped out the economy along the way big time!!!!  TFTH

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Our family has been slowly but surely working our way to complete the Jasmer Challenge--nothing looks better than those beautiful green boxes!  [:D]  K has been hearing the words "Oregon, Utah, or Georgia . . . " from D for quite some time and her reply has always been "One of these years . . . the kids are still pretty young for trips that big."  Little did she know, D's goal for this summer has been to complete our Jasmer, and it all started with an impromptu idea for a quick "family getaway" to Georgia for K's birthday.  When we returned, she just knew our two final empty boxes would drive him nuts . . . sure enough, a quick e-mail to some friends to see if they were in for a "speedy road trip" to Oregon got the ball rolling and what a great and fun time we had! Mission accomplished, what K thought would take years to complete was done within weeks  [:O]  [:D]  [:O]  D's a happy cacher and she doesn't have to hear his subliminal mumble "Oregon, Utah, or Georgia . . . " anymore!   [:D]   It's been an incredible journey and our family has had so much fun on our adventures!

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;This first
sentence could be the toughest; at least, it was for
me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;No, silly;
this sentence doesn&amp;rsquo;t translate to eleven.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;Simple rhymes
with dimple; meaning it&amp;rsquo;s solvable by many, even
you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;The cache
will not be found high in a tree; you can trust
me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t
this the type of puzzle you&amp;rsquo;ve been crying
for?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;To the cache
you can drive, but you&amp;rsquo;ll need to walk before you can
arrive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;Bring a
camera so you can take some pix.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;With this
sentence the longitude is just begun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;As easy as
this puzzle is I can still expect a complaint from you know
who.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;I hope I
don&amp;rsquo;t regret not putting this through a peer
review.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t
you just love the surrealist works by Joan Miro.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;Or perhaps
it&amp;rsquo;s the sculptures by Henry Moore that you
adore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;Can you stand
one more pun? Sure you can; we&amp;rsquo;re almost
done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;Some puzzles
are easy, some are hard; I try to publish an eclectic
mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;Now
we&amp;rsquo;re done, I&amp;rsquo;ve had some fun, had some kicks even
without tricks.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Do you remember using old technology.  Probably one of my longest held memories was using an adding machine with columns of numbers and a big crank handle to tally trick or treating visitors at Halloween.  Another memory is using rotary dial telephones.  Just about any day as a teen I'd be using that dial.  Dialing just doesn't have the same meaning with push buttons.  Every year technology keeps pushing forward, changing the way we do things.  Going back to my school days, I can remember big changes with the influx of computers.  Looking back at when I began college, I'd type my term papers and such on a Royal portable typewriter.  Choices we have today such as using the ten key pad or the numbers across the top of the keyboard were not an option.  Back then we'd learn to use "l" and "O" to replace the ones and zeros to reduce the number of keys.  Our lives have changed greatly as technology pushes us on.  Moving on in my college days, I began using Wordstar on a PC.  Word processing became a must.  Just about the end of college, desktop publishing became a requirement.  Sadly, these are memories, and kids these days think an adding machine was something like a ten key calculator, and have no clue about Ditto machines or PBXs.

[Edit: 12/29/11] I received a message from the CO. It's confirmed that the object I checked in the first try is the place of the hide. He gave me a permission to log a find, but I prefer to physically sign the log if the cache will be back soon. But if not, I may take the offer and log a find.

[Edit: 1/1/12] It doesn't seem that the cache is going to be back so soon, so I'm converting it as a find.

Often when I'm out geocaching, I could use some internet access to log my finds, check my email, do research, etc. I'm frugal (cheap) so I try to get my internet access for free. This is one spot where I could do just that, and get a good potent cuppa joe too. And they also let me use their rest room, the key for which is attached to a red rock. I even created this cache using their WiFi services minutes after placing the cache. Have fun!  Bonus points if you log using free WiFi.

p.s. GPS reception here stinks, and it is BUSY BUSY BUSY during the day and anytime the caffeine junkies are about.  The best EPE I could get is 65 feet.  So I advise you to read the hint.  Beware that those inside can see you through the window.  Sorry, the only other alternative is a boring lamp pole cover hide in even worse visibility.

p.p.s. Use Google Earth for a good aerial view and pretty accurate location of the cache,</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Periodically I receive comments that some of my puzzles which seem elementary are too difficult.  I placed this cache intending it to be one of my typically easily found traditional regular sized caches.  But upon thinking about it I decided the traffic that a traditional cache generates would make this all too obvious to muggles.  So I looked to the boys who are still in elementary school and came up with a little math for your enjoyment.  There is nothing inventive about this puzzle. This is intended to be relatively easy using common puzzle techniques, and I included what I think are plenty of clues.  If you want help solving it send me an email.  

8+4=  7+2=  5+3=  5+1=  
16-4=  2-1=  4-1=  14-2=
13*1=  7*1=  3*1=  1*1=
36/2=  42/2=  54/3=  8/8=

The cache is a needlesly camoflaged nut jar originaly filled with kids meal toys, and things from a cache where the ammo box was stolen.

This hide is near the now-defunct Minton's lumberyard. I remember going there with my dad when he needed a certain special piece of wood for something or other. That would be 45 years ago, in a Mountain View far, far away. The cache is a nano.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Man, this coin trading has really gotten out of hand. I thought
narrowing my focus to only the state coins would help, but I'm
still spending way too much time on this. Most days, at least a
quarter of my email is related to coins.
&lt;p&gt;A couple of nights back, I logged into my email and found that
it was even worse than usual. Have a look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sandke.com/CoinTrading.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I slammed my head into the desk in frustration. "&lt;i&gt;All this
coin trading is stopping me from going out after caches&lt;/i&gt;," I
thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a feeble attempt to regain my sanity, I went out and hid a
cache. It's a magnetic key holder, hidden in a traditional fashion.
I felt a bit better after that. Then I returned home and started
answering all those emails. After all, I &lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt; need that Nevada
coin...well, maybe I don't &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; it (I'm not that hard core),
but I certainly &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;

He told me it was doable and encouraged me to try it.  He was right.  It is very doable and very clever at the same time.  Just the kind of puzzle I like.

Went out for the retrieval this evening and was wondering if it might still be there since it hadn't been found in 8 months.  Sure enough, it was still in place, covered in cobwebs and a bit rusty and difficult to open but it was there.  Woohoo!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was a very satisfying find today.  I have been looking at this puzzle off and on for five years.  I got the basic theme quite quickly, but then I was frustrated by not being able to figure out the final step.  I'd pull up the page every once in a while and reread everything, and maybe find another potential clue every so often.  A couple of weeks ago, when I was looking at it, and decided I could probably narrow down the general area of the final, but not enough to go brute force it.  That did, however, convince me that I knew which information I needed to use, just not how to use it right.

I finally got a little less lazy this last week and organized the information I had a bit better.  Almost immediately, I noticed something interesting, and had the coordinates so after.  Very satisfying, as I said.  But it also telss me that there are certain solving methods that I am probably never going to use all that well - I'm just too lazy.

Anyways - that last step - ja, very subtle, but I now see it.  Koi and I took tu bao bao for another walk this evening, and stopped by to find the cache.  Now I need to choose another puzzle to be frustrated by for some time.  That shouldn't be hard - I have penty to choose from.  Thanks for the puzzle.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">22:45. Happened to look at this cache and noticed that it had been much simplified and lots of extraneous info was removed. Unfortunately, I think I still wouldn't have been able to figure it out, except that I still had the old removed hint, and that led me to the solution. Not sure whether I found the cache or something replaced by the previous finder, as the logsheet contained only one rubberstamped name on it. There was some evidence of trimming that may have taken away the real cache, as the one I found was not in the compass direction indicated by the hint.

This cache is ON Moffett Field, and you need to be a US citizen and show a driver's licence to visit.  Some people have had trouble getting onto Moffett Field if they say they are seeking a geocache, but I was told that if you specify a building when you reach the main gate they will let you on.  So...

*when they ask where you're heading tell them you are going to building 17, the old Navy HQ building to see the old benchmark from 1948 to the right of the entrance.* You really must see the benchmark, its quite unusual. Also, while you are on the base you might consider visiting the museum where they have images of the old blimp that was in the big hangar. 

Anyway, from the building 17 you can walk to the cache, and they say that's fine. This cache contains many cool NASA things like mission stickers etc. This is a must stop for NASA fans. </groundspeak:long_description>

24x7, but the park only open from 6:00 AM to one-half hour after
sunset. There is lots of street parking. The puzzle is some what
hard but the cache is easy to get to.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache in placed in a new city park in Mountain View on very
near Highway 101 in a quite neighborhood. 
&lt;p&gt;The parks has some nice landscaping, picnic tables, and play
area. Of course there is a little puzzle to find the cache. This
cache is best to find at night since there are bound to be muggles
around. There is lots of parking on the street. The cache is small
cache with a log, not much room for anything else. BYOP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location of the cache is the park but you will have to solve
the puzzle to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Puzzle Option One Replace the letter with answer the to the
questions below.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N AB CD.EFG W HIJ KL.MNO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some animal rockers in the play area. Some are wet and
some dry. Some are similar but are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = The number of animal rockers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = How many letter are in the name of animal that swim in the
sea but is not a fish? They might call him Flipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = How many swim in the sea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D = How many legs do they have?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E = The number of letters plus one of the animal that swims but
is not “B”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F = The number letters of in the name of the animal that is
separated from the other plus four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G = If A = 0, B = 1, and C = 2, etc. the value of fifth letter
of in the name of “B” H = How many live on land?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I = The number of legs in “D” divided by 2 J = The number of
animal rockers plus one then divided by two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K = The number that can fly in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L = The sum of “H”, “I”, “J” and “K” M = In all the names count
the total number of letter that appears the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N = The number of letter in the shortest name of an animal that
lives on land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O = The sum of A through N plus one, divided by ten, then minus
one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If get all the number correctly the sum of each letter value
will equal 64.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Puzzle Option two Replace the letter with answer to the
question.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N AB CD.EFG W HIJ KL.MNO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the name of the park and translate each character to it
ASCII numeric value and then add them down to one digit. Only the
first letter of each word is capitalized. For example the ASCII
numeric value of “b” is 98, there for 9 + 8 = 17, 1 + 7 = 8 the
value of letter b is eight. If translate the fifteen letters in
name of the park correctly the sum of all the numbers will equal
91.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A = half the value second letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B = the sum of the six, ninth, twelfth and fourteenth letter
divided by the value of the first letter then third letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C = the sum second, fourth, eight, and fourteenth letter then
subtract the higher from the lower to get one number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D = add the value of the fifteenth letter and the value of the
seven letter. Then add those two number together to get one
number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E = add the value of the first letter and the value of the
thirteenth letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F = the value of the fourth letter added to to half the value of
the eight letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G = multiple the value the seventh by the value of the tenth
letter, then add the value to the sum of the first and sixth
letter, then divide by the value of ninth letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H = the difference between the tenth letter and the eleventh
letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I = multiple the values of the first letter and twelfth letter,
then multiple the values of the first and eight letters, add the
first and second results, then add the number together till you get
on number then multiple by the value of first letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J = add the value of the second letter and the tenth letter and
then divide by the value of the ninth letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K = value of the sixth letter minus the value of the ninth
letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L = sum the values of third, fifth, and ninth letters, the
multiple by the value of the first letter, then divide by the value
of eight letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M = the value of the tenth letter minus the value of the seventh
letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N = add the values of the eight, tenth and fourteenth letters
then divide by half the value of twelfth letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O = sum the value of the tenth, twelfth and thirteenth letters
then add that number to get one number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get all the values correctly the sum of the numbers will
equal 64.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About this cache:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Moffett Field was established in 1931 to house Navy dirigibles
intended to support the U.S. Naval Fleet2?Ws Pacific Ocean
maneuvers. Hangar 1 was built to house the USS Macon. In 1945 the
airfield was renamed after Admiral Moffett, who lost his life in
the 1935 USS Macon2?Ws crash, and the runways were improved to
handle modern aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1950 jet aircraft replaced dirigible operations. Moffett
Field became the largest Naval Air Transport base on the West
Coast. Most Eastside/Airfield district buildings were constructed
in the 1940s 2?W 1960s. Intense jet aircraft operations at Moffett
Field ended in 1963, due to noise and air traffic issues. Navy
Orion P-3 long-range ocean surveillance aircraft began operations.
The Navy transferred the airfield to NASA in 1994, and Moffett
Federal Airfield was established as a limited-use federal
airfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moffett Field Today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of wonderful things are planned for Moffett Field in the
near future, but even today the field is a very interesting place
to visit. It's literally a place where our future meets our past.
Historic landmarks, and buildings near them, house people who doing
great things; from building pieces of the international space
station at NASA, to retaining pieces of the field's history in
historic Hanger 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA Ames Research Center and Museum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ames Research Center currently operates a small museum which
highlights the work scientists from Ames have done over the past
decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moffett Field Historical Museum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Wednesday through Saturday, 10AM-2PM admission is free&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moffett Field Historical Society is always working to record
and retain information about the field's rich history. One way they
do that is by running this museum located within historic Hanger 1.
Artifacts, exhibits, and even a gift shop full of unique
merchandise welcome visitors who come to visit. A very interesting
place, that is often over looked by other local guides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanger 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanger 1 has been a Santa Clara Valley landmark since 1933. It
still stands today, and is often used for conventions, private
parties, and annual air shows. This massive hanger is truly an
amazing site. When looking up at the ceiling from the floor of the
hanger, visitors often feel a sense of vertigo. The hanger is so
tall and massive, that fog sometimes forms within it. It currently
is set to be transformed into the California Air and Space
Center.Also at Moffet field they have alot to do with developing
the Mars Rovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose this location not only because it's a big piece of
history for our State but worldwide with the research that goes on.
There is also many other things of interest around this area the
technology and Wetlands near this location. Google, Microsoft, the
Computer Tech Museum, SGI as well as aerospace firms reside.Silicon
Valley is where alot of the Technology boom started. Be sure to
spend a few hours here there is tons of caches near here and alot
of history around this cache.Code is on the Log book and under the
lid. This cache is located right along the Stevens creek trail.BTW
Watch out for Skunks they chase.. We were chased by one while
placing. First to find gets a FTF Found it. Be sure to get the
numbers off the lid or log book and take a picture if you are going
for all 50 states and the grand cache at the end. For all others,
just log this as a regular cache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td height="61" bgcolor="#9C856F"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logging Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; Enjoy this cache as you
would any other. If you are searching this cache as a participant
in the Cache Across America series, please post a photo of yourself
or a member of you group with the cache in your online log. If you
for some reason are unable to meet the photo requirement, please
make alternate arrangements to verify your find with the individual
cache owner. There is no photo requirement for non-challenge
participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual verification of all 50 state finds will be required
before logging the series final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If participating in the series, please take note of the three
digit code located inside this cache. Save this code in a secure
place. When you have visited all 50 caches, and have collected all
50 codes, you are welcome to seek and find the final cache! Good
luck!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

*Ring*  *Ring*  You feel for the snooze button.  *Ring*  *Ring*  It's a few seconds before you realize that no matter how hard you hit the snooze button on your alarm clock, the phone isn't going to stop Ringing.   

"Uh, Hello" you scratch out as you answer the phone.

The voice: "We've got a kidnapping.  We need you to come in on the double.  It's Vladimir Kramnik... he's been kidnapped!" 

You roll over to try and catch one more "Z" before you have to climb out of bed.  "I'll be there," you say, hanging up the phone.
 
Rolling into the forensics lab at 3AM isn't exactly your cup of tea - but you're proud of your job - you're a scientist, and all this drudgery and low pay is going to be worth it some day.  You know it.  Don't you?  This case won't be too hard, you think - After all and this is the year 2005, when cars give you voice directions, the Y2K glitch has been solved for at least 2 years, and your kid can program computers better than you.

You walk into the office, and your boss hands you a paper saying, "We found a piece of hair at his house.  Here's what we've got.  Help us find him." 

You look at the paper, which reads:

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Brute Force!  Well, mostly. I became aware of this puzzle a couple of weeks ago when a reviewer denied a cache because of the proximity to this one. Of course, I didn't know it was this one, but soon figured that out. I looked at it, and like most puzzles, didn't know where to start so I did my brute force due diligence and narrowed  it down to a rather small area which included the hide location. From that and past logs I knew I was close.  When I searched the first time I remember looking at where it is but for some reason didn't search. There went the 100% brute force. Damn rookie!

So I got a hint on where to start and it fell into place.  I got some good raw data, but the website I used to interpret the numbers was hard to read. As it turns out, I had the longitude right, but missed a little on the latitude and got the correction which verified in certitude--which I had about worn out. Having spent enough time on this I thought I would just pick it up the next time in the area. That was today but I didn't have my GPS since I was out on a quick errand.  So not knowing for sure as I hadn't looked at where the solution was, but armed with the belief that I was in fact very close I decided to look around again. This time I carefully surveyed the area for likely spots that I hadn't checked before and it was the first place I looked. I guess I haven't totally lost my brute force mojo!

Eventually, I came back to the correct theme again, and somehow avoided the twin pitfalls of over-thinking the puzzle and under-thinking the puzzle. Voilà! Coordinates appeared! Like others before me, I encountered a bit of ambiguity, but once I sorted it out, Certitude confirmed my coordinates. This afternoon, I was going to be in the area, so naturally I had to drop by to search for the cache. I found it fairly quickly thanks to the hint provided by Certitude.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Auld Lang Syne is a song written in the 1700’s by Robert Burns. It is one of the better-known songs in English-speaking countries, and it is often sung at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Day. Like many other frequently sung songs, the melody is better remembered than the words, which are often sung incorrectly, and seldom in full.

So lets lift our glasses, pass the haggis, and sing it loud and clear. Have a great New Year!

Should old acquaintance be forgot,
and never brought to mind ?
Should old acquaintance be forgot,
and auld lang syne ?

    CHORUS:
    For auld lang syne, my dear,
    for auld lang syne,
    we'll take a cup o’ kindness yet,
    for auld lang syne.

And surely you’ll buy your pint cup !
And surely I’ll buy mine !
And we'll take a cup o’ kindness yet,
for auld lang syne.

    CHORUS

We two have run about the slopes,
and picked the daisies fine ;
But we’ve wandered many a weary foot,
since auld lang syne.

    CHORUS

We two have paddled in the stream,
from morning sun till dine† ;
But seas between us broad have roared
since auld lang syne.

    CHORUS

And there’s a hand my trusty friend !
And give us a hand o’ thine !
And we’ll take a right good-will draught,
for auld lang syne.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;font color="red"&gt;Cache is not at the posted coordinates, but it is
within a mile. Solve one of the three puzzles below to find the
coordinates of the cache.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;Puzzix: Puzzles For Everybody!&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo; is a series
of caches with three main intents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1: To provide easy puzzles that anybody can solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2: To provide an immersion into puzzling to people who really
don&amp;rsquo;t solve puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3: To teach. Teach about puzzles, and about the information the
puzzles are about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It bothers me (only slightly) that there are so many puzzles
around here, and several of them have so few finds. The same group
of people solve find all the puzzle caches, and most cachers only
focus on Traditionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main set of qualms I have with that is that puzzles have so
much to teach. If it weren&amp;rsquo;t for puzzle caches, I
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about 128 bit integers, fruit
identification, the makeup of colors in computers, C++, Page codes,
cryptograms, ASCII-Hex conversion, Jpeg encoding, and much much
more. Time for me to give back to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Cache in this Series will have three puzzles associated
with it. The best part is, all three puzzles give you the same
coordinates! You only need to solve one of the three puzzles to
find the coordinates. In your log, tell me which puzzle (or
puzzles) you solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the First in the series, and it will focus on multiple
images. Every puzzle on this cache page will be composed of a
series of pictures. These puzzles are supposed to be easy, and more
than anything, teach you. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;font size="4"&gt;Puzzle #1 ReCACHETA!&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, Luis Von Ahn and several other students at
Carnegie Mellon were confronted with a problem. How to prevent bots
from making e-mail accounts and sending spam. The answer was
Captcha. It provided a method of identifying humans from robots, by
putting up an image with distorted text in it. To make an account
or send a message, the user had to identify the text in the image,
something a bot could not do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, the creator(s) had a realization. They were wasting
millions of man hours of work . Or phrased in the words of Luis, "
had unwittingly created a system that was frittering away, in
ten-second increments, millions of hours of a most precious
resource: human brain cycles."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But being the genious that he is, he created the system,
ReCAPTCHA. There are two words in the ReCAPTCHA system. One is to
identify that you are human, and the other is a word from an
undigitized book. When you type in your Captchas, you are
translating ancient documents into digital text. It really is quite
amazing. ReCAPTCHA&amp;rsquo;s website can probably say it better than
I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReCAPTCHA is used on several popular sites, Facebook,
Craigslist, Yahoo, and even Geocaching.com!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it turns out that if you only answer the word that is
identifying whether or not you&amp;rsquo;re a human, but get the other
word wrong, your Captcha is still correct, and it goes through.
(Although than that word is digitized into a book, so don&amp;rsquo;t
go doing that on purpose.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s assuming you can differentiate between the
CAPTCHA word, and the book word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;font size="4"&gt;Puzzle #2 Turtle Bay&amp;rsquo;s Sundial Bridge&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Turtle Bay Exploration Park lies the only GPS Adventures
cache so far, but much more important and relevant to this puzzle
lies the Sundial Bridge! Sundials have been around since ancient
times. In those days, all you needed to tell time was an Astrolabe
and what time you wanted to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you point your arm at the North Star, you get two data
points. Which way North is, and your latitude. Those are the only
two things you need to know to make a Sundial work. Fit the hand of
your Sundial to that latitude, point it north, and voila, you have
your own sundial! Ancient civilizations knew how to do this, and
thus they could measure the direction of the shadow at one point in
the day, and at the same time the next day, the shadow would be
pointing the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest sundials known from the archaeological record are
the obelisks (3500 BC) and shadow clocks (1500 BC) from ancient
Egyptian astronomy and Babylonian astronomy. Presumably, humans
were telling time from shadow-lengths at an even earlier date, but
this is hard to verify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This day, we have constructed a contemporary version of this, a
sundial weighing 3500 tons, half the weight of the Eiffel Tower in
Redding, CA, in Turtle Bay Exploration Park. The same park where
the GPS Adventures Exhibit is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following pictures were all taken at Latitude 37.411, on a
day in the past when Daylight Savings Time was not a worry, and
when the sun rose at 6 AM, and set at 6 PM. See if you can&amp;rsquo;t
figure out what they are telling you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;font size="4"&gt;Puzzle Number #3: The Surprise is a Logsheet&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1842, Gustav Faberge opened a Jewelry Firm,
&amp;ldquo;Faberge.&amp;rdquo; Over the years, the firm grew, and so did
its popularity. The jewelers were stationed in St. Petersburg, and
a few years later, Faberge had a son, Carl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1885, Tsar Alexander III commissioned the House of Fabergé to
make an Easter egg as a gift for his wife, the Empress Maria
Fedorovna. The egg was made, and all involved were ecstatic. From
then on, the shop Faberge every year followed the tradition of
making a Faberge Egg for the current Tsar of Russian, except for in
1904 and 1905 because of the Russo-Japanese War. These yearly Eggs,
presented every year on Easter, became known as the Imperial
Eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50 Imperial Eggs were made, and today, 42 of their locations are
known. The 50th was never finished, but still is in a museum, along
with the others. After the Russian Revolution, the House of Faberge
was nationalized by force by the Bolsheviks, and no more eggs were
made. A few years later in 1920, Carl Faberge died, and the
tradition of Faberge Eggs faded into history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Imperial Eggs all either have a surprise inside, or a clock.
In many eggs, the surprise has been lost and no one will ever know
what it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Faberge eggs are some of the most prized things in the
world, appraising today at near priceless. Each one is an amazing
work of art, and is very beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my trip to Russia, I picked up a replica of the generic Red
Faberge Egg. It opens up, and is completely hollow, perfect for a
cache container. Fits a log and small swag. (Like I&amp;rsquo;d ever
put my Faberge Egg in a bush&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to show you the beauty of the Imperial Eggs, here&amp;rsquo;s
some pictures of them. Perhaps you can assosiate some numbers with
them, maybe their order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://i927.photobucket.com/albums/ad112/Grafffittti/asdf/eggs-1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Well that&amp;rsquo;s it for the puzzles. All three contain the
same coordinates, which is feet more away from GZ than I would have
liked. (Couldn&amp;rsquo;t get a good reading that day.) I hope if
anything you learned something. Something about Captchas, Sundials,
Faberge Eggs, or that anyone can solve puzzles, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t
just have to be a single community of people. In your log, put
(without spoilers) something you learned, and don&amp;rsquo;t forget to
include which of the puzzles you solved!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I tried this puzzle some time ago using the sun dials, but maybe my eyes aren't good enough.  Anyway, was able to solve via the other 2 methods and the help of Google.  Would have given up on this one except FrankenPuzzler shamed me into chasing down the eggs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Special Notes about the 2010 Puzzle Challenge:&lt;/b&gt; To be considered for Fastest Solver points, you must verify your solution with &lt;a href="http://certitude.comxa.com/certitude.php?wp=GC23HFB"&gt;certitude&lt;/a&gt;. Because certitude may not properly account for joint solutions, please email me team member names in the case of team solutions to ensure proper point accounting. Those who brute-force certitude may be forced to write on the chalkboard after school. All "point" scoring is arbitrary anyway, subject to change, at the discretion of the cache owner, and probably completely meaningless (I haven't decided yet whether we'll have an event in December). The real challenge is just to see whether you can solve all of these caches by the end of the year. To maintain fairness, hints should not be offered by the cache owner or other solvers until the fifteenth of the month.&lt;/p&gt;

   The cache IS located at the posted coordinates, but, in order to log this as a find, you must have found at least one cache every day for 365 consecutive days.

   You may log this as many times as you have 365-day periods as long as those periods do not overlap.

   When posting your log, please note the first day of the period for which you are logging.  Feel free to brag about the length of your consecutive-day streak.  Bonus points for any good stories, and more bonus points for anyone whose streak includes February 29th.

Not sure which requires more "Dedi-Cache-ion, the 'A Year in the Life Challenge' or the daunting search in the ivy infested GZ. To make it even more hopeless, the "Bird Sprinklers" as my bigger little one calls them suddenly turned on and could have inundated me but fortunately I was about 1.5 feet outside their maximum range. After recovering from the near soaking, I investigated a couple more spots and finally discovered the prize.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Woohoo! Day #365 and I have just logged my find for today (High School Math #3) and am claiming my smiley! The note below, written on day #340, tells the story of this journey.  Will it end today? Not yet!  Tomorrow, I claim the 366 day challenge since this is a leap year and I did cache on Feb 29.  After that, I will attempt to continue the streak through Dec 31 for the various consecutive Leap Year challenges.  And, then.....I will look forward to ending the streak and returning to a more random style of caching.   Thanks MB for the great challenge!

Previous note, written on 3/29/12:

I am only on day 340 but got home early, decided the weather was fine and it was a good day to pick this one up.  Actually, I had tried yesterday but went home without the smiley.  After a generous hint from the CO, I returned to the scene for another look.  It turns out that I was very close the first time but had given up too early.  Today, it was a quick find.

So, even though I am not there yet, I thought I would take a moment to write down some thoughts about my journey thus far.

My streak started in Oct 2010 and ended in March 2011, after 187 days, when I took a trip to the Cook Islands where there were only 7 caches to be had on a 14 day stay. So, I waited a month, didn't do much caching and then started up again on April 25, 2011, determined to hit the magic 366 this time.  Since I had already cleared out much of the area around my neighborhood, the challenge started early.  I turned to working on some of the more difficult puzzles for weekday finds and venturing further away for  hikes or roadtrips on the weekends.  Going into an area and picking up only one cache really hurt.  I was aching to pick up the others and clear the area but had to save them for the future.  Like others, I left the ones near home for rainy days, late work days or other emergencies. Sometimes that backfired as caches went missing or got archived.  DNFs became serious events, particularly on days when work went on late, it was dark and I was hungry.  The carefully planned find didn't materialize and I would be scrambling for a backup to give me my one-a-day.  

And then there were the angels.  A little over half way into my journey, a cacher name SeanStafford decided to up his caching karma by placing many, many caches. Fortunately for me, most of them were in the vicinity of my neighborhood which made the latter part of my journey so much easier. Thanks SS and the many cachers nearby who placed caches, allowing me and others to pursue these types of streaks. Other angels helped out just by being there, giving moral support as well as puzzle solving clues and hide hints.   

26 more days!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Well, this has been an interesting challenge.  I found and signed the log today, to make this our 369th consecutive day with a find.  When this one came out, it was just a month after I had put out our Challenge of Resolve, and I had little intention of starting a consecutive streak.  It was also just before tu bao bao arrived on the scene (of course, we knew she was coming).  It only took me two months to decide that if I ever wanted to do a geocaching finds streak, it was probably best to do it while she was young, and more subject to our whims.  So on April 1st, 2011, we began our first attempt at continuous caching - before that, I think our longest streak was maybe 17 days.  It took almost a third of a year to surpass our longest inactive period of 107 days.

There have been positives and negatives for me about maintaining a streak.  I found that it has gotten me to go after some of the more difficult urban caches that I otherwise would have just 'left for later.'  But there were definitely days when I just really wanted to focus on my work, or get home, or had already had two or three DNFs, and wasn't too excited about heading somewhere else just to make a find on that day.  After rereading kablooey's log for this one, I do sort of see how making it through the first year and really making it a habit is the hardest part.  At some points, I found myself 'pre-locating' a few caches, in case I was unable to find another during the day.  That back-fired a couple f times, when the cache disappeared and got archived before we ever signed the log.

With the 'Look Before You Leap' Challenge arriving this year, I plan to try extend our streak to the end of this year, and maybe to a full two years.  I think I have the caches around home/work/weekends partitioned enough to manage that.  But once it is done, I look forward to not needing to go out and make myself find another cache each and every day.

I had already had two DNFs in the morning today, and was a little nervous about this one after reading some previous logs.  But the coordinates were quite good, and I looked where I would most likely want to place a cache if I were putting one out here.  It was a pretty quick find.  Thanks for the interesting challenge.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;big&gt;No programming is actually necessary for level
1!&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Way back in grad school (lo these 5 or 6 years ago) I needed to
teach myself a programming language called Python. The way I
learned it was by solving the &lt;a href=
"http://www.pythonchallenge.com"&gt;Python Challenge&lt;/a&gt;--33 of the
most maddening, oblique puzzles I have ever encountered. (Well,
until I moved to the Bay Area.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though the later stages can be difficult, the first few levels are
&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; easy, so you can get your feet wet without even
needing to program.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;a href=
"http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/0.html"&gt;Start Here&lt;/a&gt; at
level 0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The solution to each level is a URL that takes you to the next
level. To find the location of this puzzle cache, solve Level 1 and
note the word at the end of the URL.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enter that word &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;a href=
"http://certitude.comxa.com/certitude.php?wp=GC2BG6B"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
to get the coordinates of the cache. (For example, if the URL ended
in &lt;em&gt;foobar.html&lt;/em&gt; you would enter &lt;em&gt;foobar&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You might find this site useful, especially if you continue the
Challenge:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trypython.org/#part1"&gt;Interactive
Python prompt -- in your browser!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; You can solve
most of the Python Challenge using just this. Comes with a nice
tutorial, &lt;strong&gt;suitable for beginners&lt;/strong&gt;, that you can try
immediately.&lt;br /&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I recently became aware of this puzzle series when I noticed the one on Stanford's campus. I had mused with the idea of trying to create a puzzle cache based on a programming puzzle in the past, but never acted on it. So I was really taken with this one! I also hadn't stumbled across the Python Challenge before, so I was very glad to learn about it.

Over this summer, I had already planned to work with crossbow spartan and help him learn some programming skills. We hadn't made a final decision about what language yet, but this cache settled the matter. So I began solving the Python Challenge puzzles to get out ahead of him so I could tutor him as he progressed. We knew that we would be making a trip to the Bay Area, and that there was no way that he could possibly get through all of the Python Challenge in time, so we settled for just getting started. He had no trouble getting through levels 0 and 1, of course, and in fact he knew how to solve them without even starting to use Python. But after he had them solved we still went back and did the programming. [:)]

So we were finally able to come and begin this series this afternoon with a quick and easy find. Great idea! TNLNSL. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Anyway, I enjoyed the puzzle and I enjoyed the cache. Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Xavier couldn't help but notice the two young women sitting in
the corner as he entered the coffee shop. One of them, with her
long blond hair flowing down along her shoulders, appeared to be
reading a thick textbook. The other, with short dark hair, was
typing away at her laptop. &lt;i&gt;"I wish I knew how to talk to women
like that,"&lt;/i&gt; Xavier thought to himself as he ordered his large
coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon receiving his drink, Xavier made his way to a nearby stool,
not too close to the women, but close enough that he could observe
their behavior and hopefully listen in on their conversation. He
overheard the one on the laptop mention something about their
classes at De Anza, and how she wish she could find a cute guy like
the one over there. &lt;i&gt;"I'm the only guy in here,"&lt;/i&gt; Xavier
thought to himself. &lt;i&gt;"She must be talking about me."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overhearing that comment gave Xavier the boost of confidence he
needed to aproach the girls. He pulled up a chair and introduced
himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hi, I'm Xavier, but my friends just call me X."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hello X," replied the blonde. "My name is Winona."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And I'm Nina," continued the other one, her jet black hair
perfectly contrasting her exotic facial features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xavier exhaled. He had never been good with women, and just
getting up to courage to come over and introduce himself was more
than he usually could muster. Now he had to somehow continue the
conversation. He tried to think about all of the pickup lines and
conversation starters he had read on the Internet or seen used on
countless reality TV shows. But his brain froze, and all he could
think of was one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So, what are your signs?" he meekly asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winona looked up from the copy of Sullivan's &lt;u&gt;Algebra and
Trigonometry&lt;/u&gt; she had been studying, glanced over at Nina, and
gave a chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That is such a bad pickup line. You really want to know my
sign? It's..." and she started to rattle off a string of digits.
And when she stopped, Nina continued with a grin. "And mine is ..."
and she, too, rattled off a string of digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"OK, I get it," replied Xavier. "You're making fun of me."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Actually, " replied Winona, "you seem like a nice guy. Here,
we'll write it down." Winona opened up her nearby backpack, pulled
out a piece of paper, and wrote on it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="courier"&gt;Winona: 0.8474082&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She handed it over to her friend, and she added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="courier"&gt;Nina: 0.607388&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I don't get it," said Xavier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's simple," replied Nina. We're meeting after class to take a
walk. If you think you have a compatable sign, then you'll know
where to meet us. We'll be there at 3 PM. The only other thing you
need to know is that it is within 2 miles of here. But now we need
to go to class. Hope to see you at 3." And with that Winona and
Nina gathered their things and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the rest of the story?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's just say that a container was left at the meeting place.
If you find it, it should fill in any remaining cracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For extra credit, when you log your find, include your favorite
pickup line. Maybe Xavier will be able to use it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Still, I can't really complain; I should have seen it coming. Hearing the refrain, "Umm... Didn't you already solve that?" is commonplace with me, and with this kind of puzzle, it was inevitable, as it plays on all my greatest weaknesses!

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Initially, I was giddy and thrilled to read the cache description, quickly understand Winona and Nina's intentions, and speed Xavier onto the meeting place! Except...I couldn't find the meeting place. I tried and tried and tried. How could I be so sure that I was right and somehow be so wrong?!?!

Three and a half months later (yah, seriously!!!), I finally kvetched to kanchan, he pulled up the listing, and five minutes later, he had coords in hand. [:O]

Floodlights filled the room. I looked at my notes. Oh. I see. It's right THERE. [:I]

Of course, after such a hilarious and absurd experience, I had to pick this one up as my 200th puzzle find and drag kanchan along with me! We poked and prodded, peeked and pulled, and after realizing that we should try a slightly different location, my geofriend came up with the cache. Yay! Smiles all around as we signed the log. TFTC and the adventure!</groundspeak:text>

[XX(] Don't know why, but, for some reason, (maybe it was finding out how Vulnerable I was to cute bunnies), I decided to look again last night and had it all solved and certified within 1/2 hour (including one crash which resulted in my having to reconstruct the data over again). [:D]  I had figured out how to make best use of the available resources.  But, I have to admit that I still don't have any answers as to WHY memes and WHAT are memes anyway? [?]   What does meme mean? [?] Where did the name come from? [?] What, if anything, do people do with them? [?]

The hide this morning took longer to find than solving the puzzle. [B)] I searched 1/2 hour in the wrong place (apparently) before giving up and walking away.  As I was headed back to the car, I decided to go back in and try one more place, wondering all the time, why in the world was I going there? [?] It's too far to the left of where the coords appear to be pointing me.  Just a waste of time.  And I am already late for work. There would be no cache there.  OH WAIT??? What is that?

I wasn't aware of most of these, but it good to know what's popular these days (though there are some I would rather have remained ignorant of.)

Based on the 6 to 1 D'oh to woohoo ratio, a lot of people made the same mistake I did in overlooking the offset.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Cache is a black-taped 6" diameter plastic jar, containing small toys and a log and pen. Large enough for TBs. Lots of muggles while school is in session adjacent. Synonymous school was once attended by Steve Jobs, when he lived in the neighborhood.

Monta Loma Park is in the center of Monta Loma neighborhood in Mountain View, whose name probably derives from slightly garbled Spanish "montón loma", meaning "mound hill." 

This area has been in continuous habitation since classical times, formerly the location of an Ohlone settlement with an adjacent refuse/dung/burial mound.  The latter site, "Castro Mound," was located on the then-Mariano Castro rancho in the nineteenth century. It was designated as a heritage resource site in the 1940s as CA-SCL-1, and was deemed one of the most important archaeological sites in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Teams from Stanford University and UC Berkeley excavated and studied the area several times between 1893 and the early 1950s, and found prehistorical refuse as well as numerous human remains, reflecting a record of human occupation going back to the range 200 BCE - 100 AD.  

However, the late nineteeth and early-mid twentieth centuries also exhibited a rather careless approach to Native American sites...  any remaining village structures on the Castro rancho disappeared as the land was reused and then subdivided.  The 300'x400', 6-foot-high mound itself, given its composted human and food waste content, was partially dug up and mined as ferilizer for local orchards, scattering artifacts widely.  The actual mound site is about 900' southwest of the cache (thought to be around Nita x Betlo Ave.), underneath the homes built when the site was bulldozed and flattened in 1952-54. A nearby defunct shopping mall was built in the mid-1960s.

As you look at today's sports fields and suburban homes, keep in mind the 2000-year-old Native American presence that preceded it... as well as how cavalier our society once was with its cultural artifacts.

I replaced it a bit more in line with the hint, but some of the previous logs make me believe that my placement is not what it used to be.  It may be a bit easy to spot by accident.  As far as I could tell, the contents were fine, except that there was no log sheet.  I added a scrap of paper that I signed.  Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This geocache is #10 of 15 in a series that spans around the lower
half of the bay. Each cache in the series contains a sentence to a
story that contains clues to a &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC2P94D"&gt;BONUS
16th puzzle cache&lt;/a&gt;. So, for ease of finding the bonus cache,
&lt;b&gt;you should write down all 15 sentences because they are all
required to solve the puzzle cache.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">** It's worth noting that each cache in the regular series was
designed to be a quick find with easy access to/from the freeway so
that the adventures cacher could continue on with the series with
minimal downtime! Most of the caches are pretty simple hides, and
you may find muggles to be your greatest challenge. The intent was
to have the series be an adventure that leads to a more exciting
and rewarding bonus puzzle cache. **&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Series Background&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I came up with the idea for doing a cache series that spans the
lower half of the bay a few years back, and decided to create this
behemoth series as a surprise birthday present for kobidge in Fall
2009. I set up all 15 caches (and the BONUS puzzler cache) and
joined her as a chauffer and mostly useless accomplice that played
along. We made it through the full series in about 3 hours then
spent a good 30 minutes solving the puzzle to find the secret bonus
cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Naturally, this lead to "extra secret" caches within kobidge's
abode, and those ultimately lead to the physical gift. A year and a
half later, we revisited the caches to make sure they were all in
place and had dry logs, and indeed they were all there!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will note that kobidge is still listed as the FTF on all the
cache logs, so consider "Second To Find" the prestige worth aiming
for.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;General Suggestions:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are clues in all kinds of places with this series. There may
be additional information in the sentences at each cache that will
help solve the puzzle, or additional information in the cache pages
themselves. Be vigilant!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Reward/Winners!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One lucky Second To Find cacher will be awarded with a &lt;u&gt;nano
cache&lt;/u&gt; as a prize at the BONUS puzzler cache, so have at
it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
** Congrats to &lt;b&gt;cyan_blue&lt;/b&gt; on the coveted Second To Find and
first to find after published! **&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
**** Super Extra Congrats to &lt;b&gt;oaknest&lt;/b&gt; for being the first
cacher to complete the regular series and win the prize! ****&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; The entire series can be done in 2-3 hours at the
fastest, and while you can grab them in any order, it is
advantageous to find the caches in order. &lt;b&gt;Don't forget to write
down the full cache sentences!&lt;/b&gt; The Puzzle cache page can also
be solved through other means, but I added many layers of
obfuscation to insure that sane geocachers would have an easier
(and more enjoyable) time finding 15 other caches that lead to a
bonus 16th cache.&lt;br /&gt;

The AMES Research side is not accessible to the general public, but the side where Airship Ventures Building 20 is located is. It may be easier to enter at the gate on Ellis Street. 

Show the security gate your government issued ID and tell them you are going to explore the Historic Museum on base (Wed-Sat 10am-2pm), or to Airship Ventures. Exploring the museum really gives a wonderful history lesson of the area.

I have received permission for the placement of this Geocache from the NASA Ames Research Park Chief of Security and Public Inquiries Officer. 

The FTF will find a Geocoin and some other little trinkets. A pen has been provided, so please keep it there.

Congratulations to the FTF - The North Star! I will be updating the coordinates when I get a better GPS, but until then, it's really not too difficult to find with the hint! Updated difficulty to 2.5 for the coordinates being slightly off and the stealthiness required on base :)</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of sixteen caches in the Light Rail Cache

Take a ride on the light rail. &amp;nbsp; These caches have been
designed to get you out of your auto and spend some time on public
transportation, but you do not need to ride on the light rail to
find them. &amp;nbsp; Each of the sixteen caches has been placed near
stations along the &lt;a href=
"http://www.vta.org/schedules/lr_interactive_map/lrBusMap.html"&gt;Santa
Clara Valley Light Rail&lt;/a&gt; line. &amp;nbsp; Each cache can be logged
on its own, but you'll need to find the first sixteen caches in
order to obtain the coordinates for the seventeenth cache. &amp;nbsp;
The log for each cache, except one, includes a numerical value or
code word that is used to figure out the final coordinates for the
seventeenth cache.

Even if you believe that you'll never try to find the seventeenth
cache you should write down the code word and the station it was
found at just in case you change your mind. &amp;nbsp; Please make a
note in your remarks if you traveled to these caches by light rail
shuttle. &amp;nbsp; Thanks for your visit.

&lt;big style="font-family: verdana;"&gt;I became so fascinated with the
type of ciphers used in The Rat's &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=6ad19068-a47a-42d3-bb6a-3d2c9c9a4ba4"&gt;
Route Cipher&lt;/a&gt; and crawburr's &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=c85c8e3c-b7b5-4b41-9798-7f0839324c50"&gt;
ACA#1: Rail Fence&lt;/a&gt; puzzles that I decided to create a somewhat
similar puzzle.&amp;nbsp; Both route and rail fence ciphers are
described by the American Cryptogram Association (&lt;a href=
"http://cryptogram.org/"&gt;ACA&lt;/a&gt;) as transpositional ciphers.&amp;nbsp;
This puzzle is also based on a transpositional cipher, but it's not
a version that can be found in the &lt;a href=
"http://www.cryptogram.org/cdb/aca.info/aca.and.you/chapter_09.pdf"&gt;
ACA literature.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; This cipher is vaguely similar to the
Complete Columnar cipher, but is much simpler because it only uses
a reverse order key.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cipher is best described as a linearly arranged poly-length
string reversing transposition type cipher, but I call it the Flip
cipher for short.&amp;nbsp; The cipher involves simply dividing the
plaintext into fixed length groups and reversing the order of the
text in each group.&amp;nbsp; This process is repeated for different
group lengths as defined by the key.&amp;nbsp; The following example
illustrates the encryption process.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
PT = THE FLIP CIPHER ROCKS &amp;nbsp; key = 236&amp;nbsp; &lt;font color=
"white"&gt;Press logo for helper app.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
TH EF LI PC IP HE RR OC KS&lt;br /&gt;
HT FE IL CP PI EH RR CO SK&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
HTF EIL CPP IEH RRC OSK&lt;br /&gt;
FTH LIE PPC HEI CRR KSO&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
FTHLIE PPCHEI CRRKSO&lt;br /&gt;
EILHTF IEHCPP OSKRRC&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CT = EILHTFIEHCPPOSKRRC&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Decryption is done with the same process except the key is
reversed.&amp;nbsp; To insure that this cipher is simple enough to be
solvable with pencil and paper, especially since there are no
online tools to help, I will follow specific guidelines for this
puzzle. &lt;!-- Actually press my logo to download a helper app. --&gt;
&amp;nbsp; The key values will have a range of from 2 through 9.&amp;nbsp;
The key length will be no more than 3 and will be arranged in
increasing value order.&amp;nbsp; Each group length of the key be have
an even multiple of the plaintext length.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you understand the example and the guidelines I've described,
you should be able to work your way through the following encrypted
text.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;big style="font-family: verdana;"&gt;Here's the compulsory
routine.&amp;nbsp; Do a triple flip with the 105, divide into 24, do
another triple flip, extract 15, then dismount with a double
flip.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 4 + 4 + 7 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 3 + 8 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 10
+ 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 8 + 3 = 24&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;big&gt;(Python is pretty crucial for at least one of levels
5-9.)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Way back in grad school (lo these 5 or 6 years ago) I needed to
teach myself a programming language called Python. The way I
learned it was by solving the &lt;a href=
"http://www.pythonchallenge.com"&gt;Python Challenge&lt;/a&gt;--33 of the
most maddening, oblique puzzles I have ever encountered. (Well,
until I moved to the Bay Area.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though the later stages can be difficult, the first few levels are
&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; easy, so you can get your feet wet without much (or
even any) programming experience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;a href=
"http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/0.html"&gt;Start Here&lt;/a&gt; at
level 0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The solution to each level is a URL that takes you to the next
level. To find the location of this puzzle cache, solve
&lt;strong&gt;Level 9&lt;/strong&gt; and note the word at the end of the
URL.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enter that word &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;a href=
"http://certitude.comxa.com/certitude.php?wp=GC2MNYR"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
to get the coordinates of the cache. (For example, if the URL ended
in &lt;em&gt;foobar.html&lt;/em&gt; you would enter &lt;em&gt;foobar&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You might find this site useful, especially if you continue the
Challenge:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trypython.org/#part1"&gt;Interactive
Python prompt -- in your browser!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; You can solve
most of the Python Challenge using just this. Comes with a nice
tutorial, &lt;strong&gt;suitable for beginners&lt;/strong&gt;, that you can try
immediately.&lt;br /&gt;

you'll instantly fall in love with it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Fine. One time. But if I don't like it, this 'GraffnTrix' will
never work in this town again!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maestra opened up the midi, with the phone still off the
hook, and listened to the song. Instantly, she became hypnotized.
There was no prevailing melody, no descants, it could barely even
be called a song. Most people would rather be listening to 4'33" by
John Cage, but the maestra saw past it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was half dissonance, and it was over so quickly, but the
maestra listened to the entire piece, intently. It wasn't because
the song sounded amazing, quite the opposite in fact, but she
almost seemed to hear past the music, seeing the messages it was
trying to convey. As if she could see the music forming on the
staff right in front of her eyes. It was trying to tell her
something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So, did you like it?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was no answer. The maestra was already gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Maestra?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone else picked up the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She just walked out. Almost as if the song had written a
message in its notes telling her to go somewhere."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hmm. I guess music is a powerful thing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
Of course, although you're meant to use software, it's also
possible to do it by hand. And it's always fun to see how different
softwares have slightly different interpretations of the song.
Also, you can validate your puzzle solution with &lt;a href=
"http://certitude.comxa.com/certitude.php?wp=GC2XQMG"&gt;certitude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>[puzzle]: The maestra eventually came back to mention that she really liked how the rests were long to have no ambiguity in the message, and also the fact that there was no time signature, even though those pesky music arrangers will probably add one when they arrange the piece.

Apparently, the last time I'd peeked at this puzzle was November of last year, and I really didn't get very far so decided to put it aside. Then more recently, I was introduced to a particular tool that I thought might be really helpful. Except...it wasn't. Perhaps I just didn't know how to use it properly? But no, after asking a geofriend, I discovered my choice of resources simply wasn't the right one. Hmm...

Ironically, the tool I ended up using was the same one I'd tried last fall. Yet in an all too familiar way, I hadn't realized the solution back then, threw the baby out with the bath water (an expression that has always given me the heebie-jeebies, btw), and only now came full circle to...coordinates! Quite an unexpected "AH-HA!" shocker, several "DUH!" head-slaps, and a big smile for this cleverly done puzzle. Nice one!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">'The Old Mill opened in 1976 as a boutique shopping center, the "Ghiradelli Square of Mountain View" as it was known. Stores and restaurants surrounded a two story atrium that contained a creek, old wooden mill, and large living trees and luxurious landscaping. Fargo's was a popular teen hang out, La Posada a popular Mexican-American restaurant. The mall fell on hard times in the 1980s, and after a failed conversion into a "public market" (without the creek and trees), it closed in 1989. The site is now home to the landmark New Urbanist "Crossings" neighborhood.'

When I arrived on scene, I found that there was a Comcast truck parked about 50 ft down the street, with the driver just kind of vegging inside (and faced the other way).  That seems to be happening to me a lot these days.  He seemed particularly uninterested in what was going on around him, though, so I decided to look for the cache anyways.  I had the right idea the whole time, but I wasn't getting a good view of the right spot until I really went for it.  Thanks for the cache.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;big style="font-family:verdana;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For those of you who have no appreciation of abstract math I offer the following alternative puzzle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I'm not creating puzzles or trying to solve them I play fantasy music producer.   It's like being a fantasy team manager.   I'm currently working on a new version of &lt;a href="http://www.cachbefound.net/geo/StairwayToHeaven.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;"Stairway To Heaven."&lt;/a&gt;   This new arrangement would be sung by a duet.   The idea is to have the singers alternate between successive verses.   I've had a number of demos done and the results have been mixed.   Regardless of who the singers are, there are a number of verses or single words that are not coming out right.   They're emphasizing the start when it should be the end or the end when it should be the start.   Of course it makes a huge difference.   I've made the following notes about these parts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[1,1,1] [2,1,11] [4,1,17] [3,3,8] [7,1,11]&lt;br /&gt;
[1,2,21] [7,4,4] [5,1,4] [5,1,20] [1,3,5]&lt;br /&gt;
[6,1,2] [2,2,1] [1,2,1] [7,4,3] [7,4,16]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the way, these are the singers I'm considering for this duet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!-- To solve this puzzle simple focus on the words --&gt;
&lt;!-- that are indexed (pointed to) above. --&gt;
&lt;!-- The pictures that follow were added for comic --&gt;
&lt;!-- relef. Believe it or not the math puzzle is --&gt;
&lt;!-- much easier then this one.  --&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This puzzle page seems to have changed quite a bit since I looked at back when it was published.  Back then, I failed to stumble upon the correct decoding for the math puzzle.  I looked at it again a few days back and decided to try tackling the word puzzle instead.  It's actually quite a nice one, and I seem to be the first to solve this that way.  There was one snag, the puzzle got broken at some point after publication, which the owner has now fixed up.  That may have stopped previous solution attempts, I don't know.  Taking another look at the number puzzle, it really is pretty easy with the current level of hints.  I stopped by today for a quick find.  TFTP</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:finder id="1933996">Chrysalides</groundspeak:finder>
          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The first time I looked at this, I couldn't figure out what the thousand words meant. When I checked back later, I saw that it had been revised to something less cryptic. I tried to solve it algebraically, and arrived at the result A = A. Which is mathematically correct but unfortunately quite useless. So programmer that I am, I whipped together some code, ran through a simple brute force search, got a whole jumble of numbers that didn't make sense to me, gave up, and shelved it.

Today I saw RR's log, and wondered at my solution. I ran my program again (without modification) and the coordinates immediately jumped out at me. Looking at my timestamp, I wrote the program close to midnight of May 14th. That's my excuse for not seeing it then, and I'm sticking to it [:)]

So I scribbled down the coordinates and rushed out of office at lunchtime. Arrived before the GPSr had a chance to lock to the signals. Did what the Certitude hint suggested a few times at a wrong location, before it locked and pointed me to a different location about 30 ft away where I found the cache.

I did look at the word puzzle, and couldn't figure it out. Like RR, too many puzzles, too little time. After finding this I decided to go on a mini puzzle run during lunchtime. Emphasis on "mini" [:)] Thanks for another fun puzzle and nicely constructed cache!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">When I first read this I thought it sounded more difficult than it turned out to be, so I set it aside.  Maybe I just got lucky, but when I did decide to work on the numbers puzzle a nice set of coordinates popped out more easily than I had anticipated.  With so many puzzles to work on I didn't even try the second half.  I'm surprised there aren't more solvers on this one.  It seemed much more approachable than some other cbf puzzles with more solvers.  Thanks for another interesting challenge.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;This Micro Cache leads you to something that deserves a lot more
admiration than its current, sadly chosen, location will
allow.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; It’s beautifully made, rich in fine
detail, and you will be surprised by what it’s actually made
of.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; After touching it, you will
wonder how its was made and how it can look so much like something
else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="text-align:center"&gt;The Micro Cache
container is smaller than a film canister&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="text-align:center"&gt;There is NO PEN, so
please bring your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="text-align:center"&gt;After you have found
the cache, be sure to take a short walk up the hill:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="text-align:center"&gt;Follow the short path
to the North until you reach the top of the taller
hill.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; From there you have a great
360&lt;strong&gt;°&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;panoramic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; view
of the Bay, the Dumbarton bridge, NASA Ames - Moffett Field,
Shoreline Amphitheater, and the rest of the valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If after the hill you still feel like walking, check out the
nearby modern office complex to the East with the architecturally
interesting stone patio area with large, thick, suspended glass
panels, a 1” shallow “pool” with benches that look like diving
boards, custom light poles, all surrounded by perfectly manicured
lawns and geometrically skewed buildings.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;![if !supportEmptyParas]&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;![endif]&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center" style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Good
Luck!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Our game of geocaching is relatively small and virtually invisible to most of the world.   We move about silently and most muggles don't recognize what we're doing.   But do you recognize the other players by their avatars?&lt;br /&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">"Small World"  -- I was there today finding this rarely found cache sometime after Rachell.  Okay, I guess for a Small World moment, I'd have to actually meet a local geocacher at a cache much farther away than this.  The closest I've come to that is getting within about 300 feet of xophe at [url=http://coord.info/GCZZNX]A Counting Error[/url]  in Minnesota, but we didn't realized it until later.
As for this puzzle, after getting most of the big hint now on the cache page, I got all the way to the very last bit months ago before getting very stuck.  I finally got my brain around the correct cachbefoundianism a few days ago and quickly had the coordinates.  I stopped by today and had no trouble finding the rather odd cache container.  Perhaps Rachell knocked all the cobwebs out of the way.  It's a bit damp in there, and the log is starting to mildew, but it probably doesn't really need attention for quite a while.
Nice puzzle concept.  Too bad there happens to be an acute shortage of places where yours truly would have worked in there  [;)].  TFTP</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Started working on this one the day it came out and thought the answer would come quickly. Made it all of the way through stage one and then got stuck.  Happened to be chatting with thelins on line and she asked if I was working on it.  "Yes".  We batted around a few ideas and then went on our way.  Time intervened.  I saw thelins at an event and she said, "you were right!"......What???? I had no idea what she was talking about as we had discussed the puzzle so long before and they were all just random thoughts then.  

I put it away again and more time intervened as other caching priorities came and went.  Every once in a while I would think about small world but only for a little while.  Last night was finally the night to put this one away.  I noticed something in stage one that looked like a hint but didn't know what to do with it.  Pinged thelins and she confirmed my thoughts and gave me a hint on where to look next.  I got through stage 2 and got stuck again.  Like taking something apart and putting it back together again, then looking down and wondering what those spare parts are on the ground.\, I had no ideas what to do with the spare parts in this puzzle. Hmmmmmm............  This time, I needed a bigger hint to get me past the hump and on to stage 4 which came very easily and, there they were, the coords!  BEAUTIFUL!!!

In retrospect, it all seems pretty easy.....HAHA...isn't that what they all say?!?

Picked the cache up this morning and seems that it was right where it was supposed to be although I needed a little something extra to make the retrieval.....

Thanks for the challenge!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I gather from the logs I may be the first one to solve this puzzle without assistance? This must have been my cachbefound day. I was reminded of this puzzle when I looked for a wonderful world, and since I had just found my way through the stairway to heaven, I gave this one another try. As it turned out, I had the right idea from day one, but I took the wrong fork in the road - probably like kanchan - and came to a dead end. There was no way to make anything work without the right piece of info so I set it aside until this week. Today, I tried an alternative, had the aha! moment and it went smoothly after that. I wouldn't call the twists and turns moon logic but rather necessary adjustments [;)]. I spent the longest time identifying the pictures for a couple of reasons and I still don't know one of them.
Great puzzle, I liked it, but it doesn't look like The North Star's prediction will be accurate.</groundspeak:text>

Take a ride on the light rail. &amp;nbsp; These caches have been
designed to get you out of your auto and spend some time on public
transportation, but you do not need to ride on the light rail to
find them. &amp;nbsp; Each of the sixteen caches has been placed near
stations along the &lt;a href=
"http://www.vta.org/schedules/lr_interactive_map/lrBusMap.html"&gt;Santa
Clara Valley Light Rail&lt;/a&gt; line. &amp;nbsp; Each cache can be logged
on its own, but you'll need to find the first sixteen caches in
order to obtain the coordinates for the seventeenth cache. &amp;nbsp;
The log for each cache, except one, includes a numerical value or
code word that is used to figure out the final coordinates for the
seventeenth cache.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This little puzzle brings me back to my basics. I've always enjoyed
playing with numbers. As a kid I read many books on mathematical
puzzles by famous mathematicians, or compilations by columnist
Martin Gardner and others. The idea for the puzzle below was
originally published by the French mathematician Emile Fourrey. I
found it in one my older compilations, where it was rated as
follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;difficulty level: 2 on a scale from 1 to 4, "fairly
easy"&lt;br&gt;
mathematical knowledge needed: 1 on a scale from 1 to 4,
"none"&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The instructions to find the coordinates for this cache are clear
and simple: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put all the integers (whole numbers), starting from 1, in a row
as follows: 12345678910111213141516...Go as far as needed to solve
the puzzle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;{D} denotes the D-th digit in that series. A couple of examples
to illustrate: {3} = 3, {10} = 1, {23} = 6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can determine the coordinates of the cache as
follows:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Latitude = N AB° CD.EFG&lt;br&gt;
Longitude = W HIJ° KL.MNO&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
where:&lt;br&gt;
A = {37412}&lt;br&gt;
B = {87654320}&lt;br&gt;
C = {3738}&lt;br&gt;
D = {60264027}&lt;br&gt;
E = {77777809}&lt;br&gt;
F = {8777777787}&lt;br&gt;
G = {24910780}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
H = {38890}&lt;br&gt;
I = {616163}&lt;br&gt;
J = {19888834}&lt;br&gt;
K = {488894}&lt;br&gt;
L = {30770774}&lt;br&gt;
M = {680309142}&lt;br&gt;
N = {2221}&lt;br&gt;
O = {86527065}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This puzzle can be solved by hand or with a calculator if you apply
some cleverness. I will not confirm coordinates. You have plenty of
check-digits in the puzzle to verify your method and solution. 
&lt;p&gt;The cache was originally a green plastic container of
approximatly 6" x 4" x 3" but as of 8/8/05 it is a camo painted
ammo can. At that time it was restocked with a bunch of good stuff.
Please rehide as found, and if trading, trade equitably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been reports of Poison Oak in the area, not in the
immediate vicinity of the cache, but around the last stretch to it.
Be careful and survey the area before you decide which way to go.
You can avoid most of the P.O. except maybe 1 foot or 2. On 8/7/05
I found two approaches where the P.O. can be avoided with careful
steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy and good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;PLEASE NOTE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; There is a
follow-up puzzle cache called &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?ID=102620"&gt;More
Digits&lt;/a&gt;. You need to solve Digits in order to find More Digits,
and it will greatly help you to keep all your notes/calculations of
Digits to figure out More Digits. Also, the Digits cache container
contains the hints to help you solve and find More Digits. Make
sure you take your copy of those hints, they're in the plastic bag
with the logbook. And in order to know when I need to refill them,
please include the hint-sheet number in your log. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Back in 2011 my grandmother passed away, and she was to be buried with my grandfather who passed in the 50's. We purchased a new marker that could have both names and the cemetery gave us the old marker. It was an old cast iron plate on top of a piece of concrete. I ended up busting apart the concrete and saving the plate. Anyways, it ended up in my mom's backyard, and it basically looks like my grandfather is buried in the backyard. Could this be a similarly discarded marker? This Costco marker is quite a mystery. It also makes me want to have my own marker in an unusual location. I'll have to think about where I want it to be. I loved the placement of the cache. X definitely marks the spot. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;This
puzzle involves four points that exist in three dimensional
space.&amp;nbsp; All four points fit well within a circle having a
three mile radius.&amp;nbsp; The first point has the geodetic
coordinates listed above with a specified height of 66.1
meters.&amp;nbsp; This is your starting point (Ps) and has cartesian
coordinates of Xs, Ys and Zs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The second point is the
location of the cache (Pc) and has cartesian coordinates of Xc, Yc
and Zc.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The second point has a specified height of 5.5
meters.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The vector from Ps to Pc is defined as
follows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;Vcs = [Xc-Xs,
Yc-Ys, Zc-Zs]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The last two points are the final locations of two puzzle caches,
labeled as Pa and Pb, and have corresponding X, Y and Z
coordinates.&amp;nbsp; These points have heights of 5.2 and 3.0 meters
respectively.&amp;nbsp; The vector from Pa to Pb is defined as
follows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;Vba = [Xb-Xa,
Yb-Ya, Zb-Za]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;font size="+1"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The sum of these two vectors is defined as follows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;Vcs + Vba =
[7139.1, -5616.8, -1376.6]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

be a simple puzzle, perhaps too easy, despite its
rating.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">(7:37:20 PM/fwgb) Well, I definitely found this to be easier than, say, Lost &amp; Found; but I suspect that reflects the low-balling of L&amp;F rather than any grade inflation on the CO's part.  [:)]

For a while I tried to solve this using cachbefoundometers, a unit of measurement that I imagined he had created specifically for this puzzle.  He proved not so conceited, however, and a careful reading of past logs put me on the right track.

I was fortunate enough to discover the identities of A and B over the course of solving other puzzles, sparing me the trouble of checking every [hint location] in the state.

Took an xmts sigitem, left an xmts sigitem (they're everywhere!) and a 1 yen coin.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">To log this find, tell us about a cache that has 20 or more favorite points. It could be your own hide or a cache that you have found.

Buuut.. since we have THE GIFT-  http://coord.info/GC1VN5J - we managed to successfully get around that issue. Those who have completed that puzzle cache know what i am talking about [:)]
Having the gift is essential when confronted with artfully crafted caches as I like them, such as:
Hotel C - http://coord.info/GC2ZT7R - or The Hungarian puzzle box - http://coord.info/GC39ZH6 - or Es war einmal - http://coord.info/GC24AQE.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Some say it's tacky to log a find for your own cache, others say that if it's a challenge cache, it's OK. So here goes. My all time most fun hike to a cache was the day I went after Return to Scab Island http://coord.info/GC2CE4 in Topanga State Park. The hike itself is only a few miles, but it follows a dry (in summer) waterfall with a series of ropes that are secured in the rocks. Gloves, lots of water, and long pants and sleeves are a must. Very highly recommended for anyone visiting Southern California.</groundspeak:text>

This challenge seems, in theory to be a simple challenge to complete but it has proven to be one of the most challenging so far for me. Trying to pick just one geocache, which stands out as being really special is very hard for me. I have been fortunate enough to have found so many memorable geocaches over the years and to have shared so many of these great caches and experiences with some great fellow geocachers who I am privileged to have met while geocaching. My geo-addiction has taken me to remote parts of the state in my quest for the elusive smiley and found myself scaling trees (and thus helping to conquer my fear of heights in the process!) to reach those placed by the geo-monkeys among us. My wife (the long-suffering Geocaching Widow) is originally from the Bay Area and has spent most of her life in this state. She had been continually amazed (and horrified!) by some of the locations, which we have visited while out geocaching. She has learned to just accept it when I occasionally come home covered in Poison Oak.

How could I even start to sort out all of my favorited caches and choose just one? After much tea-drinking and deep thought, I determined that my choice for most-favorite cache would have to be one, which was: old, situated in a unique location requiring a great hike to get to, have a high difficulty and terrain rating, be rarely visited, challenging to find, fill in both a Fizzy square and Jasmer month and require some amount of risk to retrieve.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;"The information needed to solve the puzzle must be available to
the general caching community and the puzzle should be solvable
from the information provided on the cache page."
~Geocaching.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had this great idea for a puzzle for a while, but one day,
I was solving puzzles, and found out the idea had already been done
just a few miles away. So I thought further, and put on my evil
hat. The puzzle can be as simple as you make it. I suspect some
will solve the puzzle fairly quickly, and for others it will take
ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many puzzles have "Aha!" moments. Some puzzles have "Aha!"
moments as to when you figure out what the puzzle actually is. In
this case, there are several Aha! moments. (I could have made this
puzzle a LOT harder.) But I chose not to. The puzzle is one that
everyone can solve, regardless of whether or not you're in the ACA,
or in High School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go along with this puzzle, I of course needed to hide a
cache. But when I hide a cache, the hide is often so clever that I
just make it a Traditional hide so as to have as many people as
possible look for it! This cache is an exception. It isn&amp;rsquo;t
well hidden, and I just wanted to get rid of the container. The
cache is at eye level for tall cachers, and mini-cachers standing
on a bench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficulty of this cache is based on the puzzle, so
don&amp;rsquo;t fret. &lt;img src="http://i54.tinypic.com/nxke8p.png" /&gt;
The prequel to this cache, "For Lack of a Better Name" works on the
idea that people often think they know where to look for the answer
to a puzzle, but actually they don't. The idea is one that goes
back to the beginning of time; people are predictable, and
therefore will try the same things other people will to find the
answers to puzzles. For example: Let's say a Geocaching puzzle has
a block of text, and in that block there are 15 sentences. One
might assume that each sentence will yield a single number. If a
puzzle has 15 images, again, one might think that each image
corresponds to a single digit. But what if this block of text has
only 9 sentences? Then obviously the number of sentences is not the
correct answer, and the cacher will have to keep trying. In that
particular case, it's obvious that the number of sentences is
extraneous, and that if one tried that, they'd be looking in the
wrong place. Many puzzles also have "dead ends" or "decoys," where
the CO intentionally tries to trick the puzzler. For example: if a
text based puzzle has its 3rd word in the first sentence is in any
way relative to the 7th word of the 2nd sentence, they might assume
that that is how the coordinates would be derived for that cache; 1
digit per word, and 3 is taken from the first sentence, and 7 from
the 2nd. But this is a trap. The puzzler is meant to follow this,
and then reach a dead end. Sometimes the puzzler sees a theme, (eg:
15 sentences) but has no idea what to do with that information.
Some puzzles plays off all of these ideas, and take advantage of
the predictability of humans. And just like the previous puzzle,
&amp;ldquo;For Lack of a Better Name,&amp;rdquo; this can be solved all in
the same way, just realize you&amp;rsquo;re not looking for the answer
in the correct place, or the correct way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://i54.tinypic.com/nxke8p.png" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing. Again, I could not think of a name for this
cache. In your log, suggest what you think I should name it! (But
don't forget to put some substance into your log too!)&lt;/p&gt;

However, there's nothing like signing a log on an unsolved cache to motivate! Like mcdurr, I finally bit the bullet and expanded my resources in order to tackle this puzzle (and hopefully others in the future). Awkward and unfamiliar with what I was doing, I gladly accepted a quick tutorial from kanchan, and I was pleased to see coords come out much more smoothly than my own attempts had produced.

In terms of the title, I don't want to give too much away, but as a nod to my outing with Winterwolfe, I think I'd go with "Tall Tales." [;)] TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

I'm not sure I've ever made a mini-caching run after work which included cachbefound hides without DNF'ing at least one of them.  So I was glad for the easy find, and happy for the rare DNF-less puzzle run.  Thanks for another fun puzzle.</groundspeak:text>

Of course this problem can be solved.  The correct mathematical expression for the solution is dimensionless and is dependent on the shape combination rather than the specific value of the X or Y.   As always, additional hints are available to those who require special help.

I looked for it a couple of weeks ago, when I first brought my daughter to this park, but I did not have a GPsr nor the exact location, only an approximate idea of whrere the cache should be. About a week, after I checked out the exact location of the cache, I could easily spot it, but unfortunately there were too many muggles, so I decided not to retrieve it. Today while doing big walk with my daughter I brought along a pen to sign the log. It was the perfect day for finding this cache, since muggle concentration was minimal. I found the cache exactly where I have seen it last time, but it was open and empty, so I was not able to sign the log. Please place a new log sheet, or let me know and I will put one!

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">Easy grab and a history lesson! Located a few blocks from Pioneer
Park, as Downtown Mountain View is at "maximum cache density". I
recommend the hint to make it an easy grab. Otherwise, you may have
to deal with muggles, juniper, and ivy.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Do you know where Mountain Views earliest settlers are
resting?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The historical background of "Pioneer Park" is often missed even by
frequent visitors. Did you know that Mountain View's earliest
european settlers are resting beneath the green grass of Pioneer
Park?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pioneer Park used to be an all-faiths cemetery, which was
covered-over by the city of Mountain View in 1966 after becoming a
bit dilapidated since burials stopped in 1905.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 It's not unprecedented that graves would be moved for a public
works project (i.e. eminent domain against the dead!), as in the
mass relocations around 1939 from San Francisco to Colma. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow"

href="http://www.sanfranciscocemeteries.com/"&gt;http://www.sanfranciscocemeteries.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
 Besides "eminent domain" against those who can't speak for
themselves, what about property rights? Those plots were purchased
by caring families!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
In the case of Mountain View, however, the gravestones were merely
pushed over and covered-up in 1966. This was despite opposition
from the "Mountain View Pioneer and Historical Society", which now
operates the History Center inside the nearby library. Their office
hours, inside the library, are limited to 8 hours a week: tuesday
from 1 to 5 and wednesday from 5 to 9. Phone 650-903-6337. Tuesday
afternoon is the best time to visit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Barbara, who also is the MV City Historian, was very helpful and
friendly when I visited. She has photos and records of the
headstones, photographed in the 1930's. The info is not on the web,
however.&lt;br /&gt;
 It is sometimes said that, except for famous people, most people
are forgotten 2 to 3 generations after they pass away. I guess that
protection of those that are forgotten can't be taken for
granted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy this easy cache and the history lesson! Why is Toys R Us
haunted (cache GCG423) and this place isn't?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Do you know where your dead relatives are?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Left a "where's george" dollar for the FTF (2001 series
F27972832E). Of course, everybody knows where George is. His grave
is safe because he's famous!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Well, times change, and now I'm able to place this one...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough of a climb to get the heart moving, though not &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt;
long, overall. You can also take the switchbacks to make the climb
easier, but longer. And once you get to the top, there's some
pretty nice views from the center of the bay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably not the best or easiest cache on summer
evenings when the nearby concert venue is in full swing (it'll at
least make nearby parking difficult, if not impossible). Path gets
lots of hikers, and I've even seen chairs up here during the day
(probably from the nearby Google'ites). There's also a nearby dog
park which operates year-round - so muggles may be a problem from
considerable distances on &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; sides (including the nearby
office windows). &lt;i&gt;Please&lt;/i&gt; be wary so-as to help preserve the
sanctity of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I've seen people out here with dogs, and there
just-so-happens to be a dog park nearby, the trailhead is marked
with a &lt;b&gt;No Pets&lt;/b&gt; sign. Also, though I certainly didn't see any
signs that restrict hiking times, I'm not sure if I'd want to be
out here after dark (though it's pretty open and I'm guessing it's
still semi well-lit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please be careful in resealing the container, as it seems
tohave one stubborn side.&lt;/i&gt; There is some room in cache for small
items and trackables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;

Imagine taking your date for milk shakes after watching Casablanca in 1942. In the 50's you might have your burgers and root beer float delivered by a car hop.  You can also imagine munching on fries and a sipping an icy  soda while rocking to the  Jefferson Airplane in the sixties.  How about the late night snack after disco'ing in your tight jeans and platform shoes in the 70's.  And, of course, all young women enjoying burgers at this place looked like Pat Benatar in the early 80's. Sorry, but I can't picture an icon for the 90's or 00's.

Anyway, this special burger joint was established in 1942, Sadly, it's been closed for several years now. Interestingly, all of the fixtures are still in place. What a blast from the past.

A vintage US postage stamp is there for the FTF.

Have fun!

Several cachers have noted that this place is eerie and surreal.  To add to the mystique, I noticed that although this business has been closed for several years, there is no dust.  Does a ghostly cleaning person visit nightly?  Check it out.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/2005f7e9-d497-44ea-bfb2-0a74e9806108.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time there were three billy goats, who were to go up to
the hillside to make themselves fat, and the name of all three was
&amp;ldquo;Gruff.&amp;rdquo; On the way was a bridge over a river they had to
cross; and under the bridge lived a great ugly troll.  Perhaps you
remember the tale of how the smallest goat crossed the bridge by
tricking the hungry troll into waiting for the next larger goat, and
likewise the middle-sized goat, until finally the largest goat tramped
onto the bridge and put an end to the troll.  Goats of the Gruff
family were stubborn and would never retreat, not even if a nasty
troll was in the way.  But they were also clever enough to think their
way around such an obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the bridge made safe, the goats crossed back and forth as they
pleased.  They made themselves very fat and had many kids.  Seasons
passed and then one day the river rose in a great flood.  The bridge
was washed away.  Afterwards nothing was left but a few stones lying
in the river; and the number of stones was seven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/285b4926-a9ad-4180-87f2-b81fa4b702f7.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goats soon discovered that they could cross the river easily
enough by hopping on the stones.  For example, a goat could hop from
the west shore to the first stone, then from the first stone to the
second stone, from the second stone to the third stone, and so on
through each of the stones, until finally hopping from the seventh
stone to the east shore.  A goat could cross the river in the other
direction by hopping through the stones in the reverse order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the stones were not separated from each other by any great
distance, so from stone to stone even the smallest goat could leap
completely over one intermediate stone; and this was true even if
another goat happened to be standing on the intermediate stone.
Sometimes several goats would cross the river at the same time,
hopping from shore to stone, from stone to stone, or in a great leap
from one stone over a goat to the stone after.  Although the goats
were very sure-footed, the stones were too small to permit more than
one goat to stand on the same stone at the same time.  And no goat was
strong enough to leap over more than one stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day a group of three small goats approached the river from the
west at the same time as another group of three large goats approached
from the east.  The three goats from the west hopped out onto the
three stones nearest to the west shore.  The three goats from the east
hopped out onto the three stones nearest to the east shore.  And the
name of all six was &amp;ldquo;Gruff.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/ce31ebff-a26c-42ff-ab3f-4d62986d3c0a.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pause ensued.  Then, one goat hopping at a time, the groups
passed through each other until the small goats occupied the three
stones nearest to the east shore and the large goats occupied the
three stones nearest to the west shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/8df4f278-6fc3-4fb2-984a-4d1f444b9ecc.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the goats continued to thrive.  The cache is at offset
016130354559415.&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, ok, offsets are my dreaded Achilles heel, but a nudge from a geofriend made me realize, duh, what I needed to do to finish my coords. And despite kanchan's encouragement, I also ultimately needed thegirlsfromPA's help to conquer the hide and make the find.

Whew - turned out to be correct and I turned out to be tall enough for the job.  Had to wait out some muggles for the replacement.  Why were they looking at us looking at them?

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I solved the first part forever ago. Ah well, I wasn't sure if my solution was correct or not at that time. Anyway, I wasn't able to figure out how I can translate my solution to a number after that (I didn't think much about it as I wasn't even sure if my solution was correct, anyway).

(many months later...)

While working on another puzzle, I realized that I would need to solve this one. So I took another look at it. I still didn't know how to translate my solution to a number, but I noticed something significant in the offset, and got what that number should look like. A-ha! That was a great moment.

Now I need to solve one more puzzle for the other puzzle. TFTC! #433/#2859</groundspeak:text>

Although I still have a couple of unsolved puzzles in this series, this was personally the hardest to-date. The difficult rating agrees since this is also the highest rated puzzle in the series. I am very impress that this was mokelly’s first puzzle cache find.
I stopped by the final location during normal working hours and had no issue with security. The cache container was a bit covered in cobwebs and the log was excellent condition.

Then more recently I was working on the CO's Black Hole puzzle and reached an impasse where it was suggested that familiarity with the CO's other puzzles might help.   So I took another look at several of the POP's.   This was during the Christmas break I must have had a clearer mind with no work distractions and several of the pops fell to me within just a few hours one day.   I was so close to asking for hints so I was really happy to have finally clued into these ones.   Today I finally managed to make the short drive from the office to grab it over lunch.

On the downside, I ended up in a rush and only had 5 minutes to try this before I had to leave for a late appt (got lost on the way there). The bittersweet part? The last finder had returned it backwards, and it ends up quite visible that way. So, found it, but can't take a ton of credit for the find.  I think I would have had a MUCH harder time finding this otherwise. Ah well. it's back and up to snuff again. Best of luck to the next attempted finder! TFTC!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I would sometimes enter a number on my dad's huge
office calculator, then press the Sqrt button over and over again
to see what happened. (Yes, my fate was sealed from an early age.)
Whether I started with 99999999 or 0.0000001, repeated square roots
eventually brough the value back to 1.000000... 1.0 is an
"attractor" of the square root function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Square function has a similar behavior: as long as you start
somewhere between -1 and 1, you'll end up at 0.000000... after a
bunch of iterations. The iterated square function is a special case
of the iterated function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f(i+1) = f(i)^2 - c&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For c=0.0, the attractor is a "fixed point": all initial
conditions tend inexorably to just one value (if they don't blow
up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens for, say, c=1.0? If we start with 0.5:&lt;/p&gt;
0.5&lt;br /&gt;
-0.75&lt;br /&gt;
-0.4375&lt;br /&gt;
-0.80859375&lt;br /&gt;
.&lt;br /&gt;
.&lt;br /&gt;
.&lt;br /&gt;
-0.999999423191&lt;br /&gt;
-1.1536182557e-06&lt;br /&gt;
-0.999999999999&lt;br /&gt;
-2.66164867924e-12&lt;br /&gt;
-1.0&lt;br /&gt;
0.0&lt;br /&gt;
-1.0&lt;br /&gt;
0.0&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function eventually ends up bouncing back and forth between
0.0 and -1.0--its attractor is a periodic point of period 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some not-completely-unrelated numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

It's a nice puzzle, really. I liked it a lot! [:)] This is why I liked math (when I still liked it [;)])! This little tiny bugger was right at the coords I had, so I didn't have any troubles finding it either. Nice in-theme location (sort of!). SL. TFTC. #2580

Making the find was a good excuse to go for a bike ride after work, though there was a strong attraction between the log and the cache container that took me a long time to overcome.  sl.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;A full size urban cache at a popular hangout for cachers...&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;When you head out onto the trails to
      find those wilderness caches, what do you bring
      along?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
In the 1950's, hikers began circulating a list of the "10
Essentials", items every hiker should have in their pack "just in
case". Over the years the list has been debated and ammended, but
it remains a good starting point for any hike. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The 10 (ok, 14, but who's counting)Essentials:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Map (on waterproof paper preferably)&lt;br&gt;
Compass&lt;br&gt;
Extra clothing&lt;br&gt;
Extra food and water&lt;br&gt;
 First-aid kit&lt;br&gt;
Headlamp or flashlight (with extra batteries)&lt;br&gt;
Matches (storm proof, or in a watertight container)&lt;br&gt;
 Fire starter&lt;br&gt;
Knife (or multi-tool)&lt;br&gt;
 Sunglasses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...often added to the list in recent years:&lt;br&gt;
Sunscreen&lt;br&gt;
Water filter(or other method of water treatment)&lt;br&gt;
 Whistle (for emergency signalling)&lt;br&gt;
 Food storage device (required in bear country)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that our trusty companion, the GPS, is NOT on the list. A
GPS, while a trusted tool for caching, should never replace
carrying a good map and compass on the trail. But it does provide
an additional level of safety on the trail and can make navigation
easier in difficult situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a regular size, and contains items related to the
10 essentials list. It is hidden with permission and full
cooperation of the nearby tenant...&lt;/p&gt;

      coordinates. It is about 7.44 miles from there&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; .</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Al spotted Aster across the room, although he didn't know who she
was. This was his first BADGES dinner and he didn't know many of
the geocachers there, but he couldn't keep his eyes off the slender
form and warm smile of the young woman talking to Jif, Daryl, and
Marky. Al wondered if he could find a way to introduce himself, but
he was a bit on the shy side.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;"I said, have you seen this one? Another one of those 2-number
caches from The Rat." It was Fy. Al realized he had not been
upholding his end of the conversation. He had totally missed what
Fy was saying to him. He focused on the printout. The text
contained nothing but two numbers printed in a large font, but
there were graphics of a nasty looking black snake in the
background. The numbers read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.8086014&lt;br&gt;
 67.4945452&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You know, there is something about this that looks familiar,
but I can't quite place it," he replied absent-mindedly, glancing
again toward the group of men who were obviously charmed by their
companion. Fy immediately perceived what was distracting him. With
a twinkle in her eye, she said softly, "You know, my husband is
good at this kind of thing. Let's go get his thoughts." Without
waiting for an answer, she led him with a gentle tug on his
shirtsleeve across the room and introduced him. "Jif, Marky, Daryl,
Aster, I want you to meet Al. He's new to the group and wants to
consult with the puzzle-cache experts about The Rat's new one."
They all looked at his name tag, which read, "Hi, I'm Al
(Nytroen)."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aster was the first to extend her hand. With a gracious warmth
that set Al's head spinning, she said, "Nytroen, yes, I've seen
your logs on some of the tough puzzles. I'm Aster." She pointed to
the name tag on her chest. Al glanced where she pointed, then
suddenly blushed crimson as he realized his eyes had lingered a
little too long on her shapely torso. As he brought his eyes up to
meet hers, he saw an expression of dubious amusement. He quickly
shook hands all around and brought out the cache page printout,
mumbling something about those confounding Rat puzzles. Out of his
field of vision, Fy waved to Dina and Joani. They arrived, and
following Fy's lead, they all retrieved their husbands and went
back to their tables. Al and Aster found themselves sitting
together studying the two numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Al worked up the courage to stammer, "Umm, Aster, would
you like to go out geocaching with me tomorrow? I'd like to find
this cache." Aster looked him over with careful scrutiny. He was
athletic and lean, with a goofy sort of lopsided smile and a pair
of really cute dimples that she found hard to resist. Seeing her
hesitate, he began to apologize, "I know we just met, and it's
something of a risk ..." "Risk is my game ... and my name," she cut
him off. She pulled out a business card and scribbled her home
number on the back. Al was amazed to see that Aster was a
professional stunt woman. The card read, "Risk, Inc."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest isn't hard to guess. They solved the puzzle quickly and
found the cache the next day. The sparks flew, and Al and Aster
fell in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

I thought I would never find Love. The hint meant nothing to me.  And then.......Another Rat puzzle came to me and suddenly Love didn't seem so fuzzy after all.  Made it through all of the steps but couldn't quite lock down the final coords until BT pointed out to me where I had gone wrong.  I quickly went back and made the corrections and headed this way today to see if I could find Love.

Arrived at GZ, and thankfully, probably due to the rain, had the place all to myself.  I took the advice of other logs and took the time to meditate on the situation until the location appeared in front of me.  Made the grab and signed the log.  Just as I was about to put it back, a muggle came by with her dog who just had to stop and do his business right there.  I walked around the in-theme location while I waited for them to finish.  Finally, they moved on and I was able to get the cache back in place.

These puzzles are so fun and clever.  I am really enjoying myself.  Thanks Mr. Rat for another good one.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;It has been said that a rolling stone gathers no moss. I
supposed that is true, although I haven't seen many rolling stones
in my life (Mick Jagger &amp;amp; Company don't count). But I have seen
a lot of non-rolling stones, and many of these stationary, static
stones have gathered moss. But due to their impenetrable nature,
that is usually about all they gather. Static logs, on the other
hand, can gather all kinds of goodies. Sure you can find moss on
them, but depending on the amount of decay, a static log can host
ferns, grass, clover and other plant life. Static logs can also
contain all kinds of animal life including termites, ants, beetles,
centipedes, sow bugs, earthworms, and spiders. Furthermore, with
all of the ingenious geocachers in the area, it should come as no
surprise that occasionally a static log contains a geocache. And
sometimes a static log even contains geocache coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I can say I wouldn't have solved this without the hint, but that's probably because I didn't participate in the kablooey puzzle contest in 2010. With the hint I got the first stage easily enough, but I was not able to discern the encoding method. Maybe it involved the referenced puzzle, but it stumped me, so I just applied standard cryptographic techniques and a little GoogleEarth research and got the coordinates confirmed on my first try.

At the cache site I had some trouble as the environment is one of those that wreaks havoc with the GPSr signal and everywhere I went it showed I was within 17 feet of the cache. There were lots of things that seemed to fit the location hint, too, and one that fit the title even better than the actual cache. Eventually, though, I spotted the cache camo and retrieved it, but then I faced a formidable challenge. The container itself had been shoved deep into the outer camo and was wedged tight and recessed. It took a good five minutes of work with my Leatherman using different tools to finally get something that could dislodge it enough that I could get it open.When I replaced it, I made sure to leave enough of the cache protruding from the camo (but out of sight) so that the next person doesn't have to go through that. I think that may be the first time I've had to use that Leatherman, although I've carried it with me geocaching for years.</groundspeak:text>

Then, I forgot about it once I got home.  This morning, I saw the puzzle again, couldn't find my old notes, so I did a quick resolve, then included the final in my afternoon walk.  Once again, at the coordinates for the cache, I poked around quite a bit, but it all looked so different from what I remember from the first time.  Finally, just as I was about to give up, I spotted it!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Element #2 is Helium. This cache honors the site of what once must have been the largest container of Helium in the Bay Area—the US Navy Airship ZRS-5, the USS Macon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Macon was launched on April 21, 1933 in Akron, Ohio and cost $2.5 million to build. It was built by the Goodyear-Zeppelin Co, a joint venture between the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., and the Zeppelin Company of Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/fd7e6402-2428-4e26-b32c-30168fa0c41a.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An airship differs from a blimp in that an airship has a rigid internal frame and gas cells, instead of being essentially a big balloon. The Macon was held aloft by 12 large cells containing Helium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I had planned on calling this cache Element #1, but upon further research, learned that the Macon was filled with Helium, not Hydrogen, as I had thought. It was built right at the time when the dangers of using Hydrogen in airships were becoming apparent and airship designers were switching to Helium. The Hindenburg was built two years earlier, and famously crashed and burned in 1937.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Macon was 785 feet long and capable of flying at 87 mph. (For comparison, the Goodyear blimps are 192 feet long.) It could carry up to 100 crew members and had sleeping berths, a mess hall and a galley. The Macon was also an aircraft carrier, as five Sparrowhawk biplanes could be launched and retrieved from the underside of the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Macon landed at the Sunnyvale Naval Air Station, now known as Moffett Field, on October 16, 1933, a base that had been opened specifically for lighter-than-air aircraft. The Macon used Moffett Field as its base for about 18 months. On February 12, 1935, it was returning from maneuvers off Point Sur when it encountered storm winds. A gust struck the ship, ripping off the previously-damaged upper tail fins and sending shards of metal into the rear gas cells. Despite battling to stay aloft, the Macon settled down on the surface of the sea, and the crew abandoned ship. Eight-one of 83 aboard survived. The crash, however, hastened the end of the Navy’s airship program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helium, like Hydrogen, is lighter than air, although it only has 92% of the lifting power of Hydrogen. However, unlike Hydrogen, Helium is completely inert. It doesn’t burn, it doesn’t support burning, it doesn’t do anything. Although other members of the “Noble Gas” group on the Periodic Table have been coaxed into reacting with other atoms, Helium remains aloof. Helium was first detected in the spectrum of the Sun in 1868. It was isolated on Earth in 1895. Its name comes from the Greek word, “helios” , meaning “sun”. It is the second most abundant element in the Universe, although it makes up only 0.0005% of the Earth’s atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a sandwich-sized Tupperware located along a public trail on the bay side of Moffett Field outside of the perimeter fence. From the levee near the cache site, you can get a good view of Hangar One, the hangar originally built for the USS Macon, as well as the other buildings at Moffett: the wind tunnels, and Hangars Two and Three (also originally built for blimps during WW II). Nearer the cache is a facility that appears to be NASA’s junkyard, but is actually the training facility for DART, the Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team. DART has deployed for just about every major national disaster since its formation in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The cache is located at a little known access road to the former
Mayfield Mall, one of the first indoor malls to be built in the Bay
Area. No mind puzzles to solve, but you'll have to figure out how
to get the cache.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Mayfield was actually the name of a township in what is now
southern part of Palo Alto. A shopping mall was built in the 1960s
near the border of Mountain View and Palo Alto, and it adopted the
name, Mayfield Mall. Even after the mall closed, County Transit
(now VTA) buses used it as a major terminus until the lot became a
campus of Hewlett Packard.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For more information, check out &lt;a href=
"http://members.aol.com/MVNick/malls.htm"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The coordinates will take you right near the cache. I have provided
a tool to retrieve and place the cache, which is nearby. Detach the
container by pushing it up after catching it with the tool. Be sure
to return the tool to its original location. Please bring a pen or
pencil with you to sign the log sheet. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Parking Note:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There is security patrolling the Hewlett Packard campus/Mayfield
Mall parking lot, so you'll need to look for street parking on
either Ponce or Briarwood.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To minimize muggles, avoid coming here during commute hours.</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">[blue]Thanks kablooey for the fun party last night. We especially like the variant of Musical Chairs whereby some of the sitting devices contained only three solid legs with the fourth not perpendicular to the floor and/or nearly falling off.  Of course everyone knows tripods can be amongst the most stable of weight supporting platforms. [;)][;)] And for the under 40" set, there was the special chair that was missing the center portion of the back support. Merriment was had by all.

I also really enjoyed experiencing the aura of that much brain power in one tiny room.  Hopefully some of it emanated my way and was successfully harvested by my gray matter.

And thanks for the blue beverage which may or may not be of natural origins because as George Carlin once observed:

"Why is there no blue food? I can't find blue food - I can't find the flavor of blue! I mean, green is lime; yellow is lemon; orange is orange; red is cherry; every other color is well represented in the food kingdom; what's blue? There's no blue! And don't bother me with blueberries; they're purple. The same is true with blue corn and blue potatoes. They're purple. Blue cheese? Nice try. It's actually white cheese with blue mold. Occasionally, you might run across some blue Jell-o in a cafeteria. Don't eat it. It wasn't supposed to be blue. Something went wrong. There's no blue food! Where is the blue food? We want the blue food!"

Finally, thanks for another year of creative puzzles that often require putting one's thinking cap slightly off-kilter.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;strong&gt;This is a no frills quick stay location, enough room for some GC's and TB's but no long term residency (toys).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Located on El-Camino Real, in front of an actual Muggle Hotel. This spot is very close to 101, 85, &amp;amp; 280...Makeing this location a great place for a GC/TB to get out of town quickly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pretty easy cache to find, but please but it back exactly the way you found it or it will be muggled...Speaking of, watch out for the occasional muggle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;em style="font-size:12px;"&gt;Located next door to at one time was Ken's International House of Pancakes...The place closed in 1999 and was a place you had to stop and eat if one was traveling thru Mountain View...Shame because they are the only place I know that served real German pancakes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

bring the kids here whenever they feel like flying a kite. Out here
by the bay, the wind is likely to be good enough for flying on most
days. 
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a peanut butter container containing a log, pen,
and some trade items. It isn't hidden on the kite flying field
itself, as there wasn't a good spot for anything larger than a film
canister out there. It was hard to get good coordinates (that's a
hint), so you may have to search around a bit. If you have better
coordinates, please post 'em and I'll adjust the listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoreline Park is open from dawn to dusk. If there's a concert
at Shoreline Amphitheater, you may have trouble getting here, and
you may find it way too busy to search even if you do get here.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a nice spot to park and access the Stevens Creek trail.  Not only is the trail nice to walk/bike but it also has a number of new caches on it.

When looking for the cache don't head down the hillside -  the cache isn't there.  Also, the high voltage power lines in the area may mess with the coords a bit, be patient.  Above all else, enjoy!

  I dedicate my first cache to the Jack Rabbits of the area. They are so beautiful and so fast, watch out for them!  Dont forget your camera and take quick pictures as they run by.
  The cache is a camoed glass jar! Has a log and some other small trinkets, need to bring a pen.</groundspeak:long_description>

not. I learned how to do this type of cipher by doing one of

instructions for solving this cache... To make it more of a cipher
tutorial... To convince those of you that may have an aversion to
puzzles that these are indeed solveable by anyone. So if you've

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
There are those among our geocaching community who have the gift.   I'm speaking of those who readily solve the puzzles that, for most of us, are unsolvable.   I'm speaking of those who are not distracted by the extraneous text, numbers, graphics or other chaff that some puzzles include.   I'm speaking of those who know how to read between the lines and those who know when to ignor the lines.   I'm speaking of those who instinctively know how to work their way through the most complex puzzles while the rest of us languish indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, some of us may have expertise in math, language, art or science but those whom I'm speaking of know enough about any subject to navigate through any puzzle.   While many of us will avoid puzzles that contain subjects we're unfamiliar with, those with the gift are undeterred.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of us would like to believe that this gift is simply a matter of experience rather than an inherent skill.   I tend to believe that one's ability to solve puzzles will improve with experience but, there will always be puzzles that remain unsolvable unless one has the gift.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, do you think you have the gift?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
For this puzzle you'll need to think outside of the box.  The coordinates you seek can not be determined in the conventional way but rather will only be revealed to those who have the gift.  Use &lt;a href="http://certitude.comxa.com/certitude.php?wp=GC1VN5J"&gt;certitude&lt;/a&gt; to acknowledge your gift or to see a &lt;a href="http://certitude.comxa.com/certified.php?wp=GC1VN5J"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of those who have the gift.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">
      </groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Dedication: Since this whole series follows my history with
computers in the Bay Area, I want to dedicate the final cache to a
true pioneer I had the honor of working with, Betty Holberton. She
was one of the first 6 programmers of digital computers ever, all
women. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Holberton The CDC Cyber
180 Series represented Control Data's final break with the 60-bit
words and 6-bit characters that were used by all models starting
with the CDC 6600. The new hardware used 64-bit words and 8-bit
characters. However, the hardware models were ready well before the
NOS/VE operating system, new compilers,etc. In order to achieve a
graceful transition, the machines had an alternate microcode that
could run all of the old 60-bit code. Therefore, they were
originally sold as the Cyber 170/800 series and appeared to be just
another hardware technology rev of the existing line. When the new
64-bit mode operating system and software was ready, all that had
to be done was announce it and let existing customers know they
already had hardware that could run the new mode at the same time
as the old mode. This provided a way for customers to move to the
new architecture while still running their old software.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were clues that observant customers might notice like
16-bit wide sets of switches in the Deadstart Panel, hardware
switches that loaded the initial instructions to boot the
hardware.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/4bb6adea-03ce-4897-a852-157f4aa66e9e.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time CDC moved facilities from the Orleans Drive location
to Clyde Avenue, the starting point of of this multi-cache, little
software development for any of the hardware was going on. The
company had morphed its remaining software talent into a consulting
style operation and some web development work. The company had been
bought by Syntegra, a division of British Telecom, and lived out
it's final days in the Bay Area at this location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FTF: Please remove the FTF sticker with secret code and report
that code when logging the cache. This will remove any confusion as
to who is the First To Find. Once the sticker is gone, no one else
can report FTF. The reason for this will become clear when you find
the cache. If you don't see the FTF sticker, then it has been
claimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-FTF finders should log the info requested in the cache when
making their "found it" report to confirm the find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole series has been about computers so it seems fitting
to have you do some computation for the last location in the
series. At the starting location look at the sign for the building
occupants. There are three rows of street numbers/names, one for
each address that is part of the complex. Computations will use
just the street number parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A is the the sum of the first two digits on the second row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B is the sum of the first two digits on the first row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C is the first digit minus the second digit on the third
row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D is the last digit of the second row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E is two times the middle digit of the third row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F is the last digit of the first row + the last digit of the
first row divided by two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sum of the digits A,B,C,D,E, and F should be 29. The final
stage is less than 1/2 mile away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located at N 37° 23.ABC W 122° 03.DEF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, try to put things back exactly as you found them so
the next seeker can have as much of a challenge as you did.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font color="#FF0000"&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you've come looking
for a way to find 5 caches a day, you've come to the wrong place -
this is a 4 star puzzle...&amp;nbsp; Well, maybe 3 stars for some
folks.&amp;nbsp; The Posted coordinates are less than 2 miles off, and
I spent (way) more than 1 hour making the puzzle.&amp;nbsp; Going to
the posted coordinates may help you.&amp;nbsp; Or it may not.&amp;nbsp;
Happy Hunting.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="100%"&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;These days, it is hard to know which foods are
healthy, and which aren't.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, we have the media to
keep us informed of the latest and greatest foods for our
health.&amp;nbsp; For example, years ago I did anything I could to
avoid &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://health.howstuffworks.com/cholesterol.htm"&gt;CHOLESTEROL&lt;/a&gt; -
substituting heaping portions of "healthy" margarine to take its
place.&amp;nbsp; Now, most of us know that you shouldn't eat margarine
because it's made of hydrogenated oils - which are supposedly even
worse than cholesterol.&amp;nbsp; Oops!&amp;nbsp; Perhaps the whimsical
media inadvertently keeps us healthy by introducing VARIETY to our
diet.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, on with the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Most of us have heard the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://www.5aday.org/"&gt;5-a-day propaganda&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The plan is
to encourage everyone to improve their health by eating more fruits
and vegetables.&amp;nbsp; Sounds simple, right?&amp;nbsp; Well, choosing 5
a day isn't so simple.&amp;nbsp; Many people these days are strong
supporters of Organic Produce and agriculture, citing that modern
agricultural chemicals harm people, animals, and even other
plants.&amp;nbsp; Yet, there are still some people who believe that it
is better to choose food that is conventionally grown &lt;a rel=
"nofollow" href=
"http://www.cgfi.org/materials/articles/2002/jun_25_02.htm"&gt;instead
of organic&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; These folks cite that bacteria and fungi on
our food is toxic.&amp;nbsp; They also point out that organically grown
plants increase production of their natural pesticides when they
aren't protected by our spray on (read: wash off) poisons.&amp;nbsp;
Many others are still undecided on the organic / conventional
debate.&amp;nbsp; And then there is also the question about &lt;a rel=
"nofollow" href=
"http://science.howstuffworks.com/question148.htm"&gt;Genetically
modified Food.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;As you can see we have a lot of food for thought here. If the
above information isn't puzzling enough, here's a real puzzle for
you:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>[Puzzle] 
I suggest that you spend some time
Investigating pear, peach, and lime
focus on details so sublime
Not on the silly nursery rhyme
If that hint's not enough, don't panic
I'll tell you one more thing - 
none of this stuff's organic

[Cache] 
Centered and 4 feet off the ground.  Somewhat deep in vegetation.  Due to loss of the previous container, there is now a new, OUTER container that houses and protects the real container.  To open the container, please just pop open the front of the lid.  Please do not remove the entire lid.  Please do not leave anything in the outer container (technically, this is a MICRO cache, but the outer container is relatively large and PERMANENTLY BOLTED DOWN (don't try and remove it - instead, reach in and grab the real cache from inside)).  Just a few feet from pavement; flat terrain; shrubbery.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

All you have to do is go to the posted coordinates and use the four digit number of this California Historical Landmark to determine the coordinates of the cache.

The cache is at:
N 37 25.(this number - 687)
W 122 06.(this number - 779)

The checksum is 40.

Best of luck!

coordinates.&lt;/font&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A tutorial type puzzle which is fun to solve in a group. So
everybody pair up, it's time for a 5 star puzzle!
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Contrary to what you might think at initial glance of the
puzzle, and what you might think in subsequent steps, you do not
need Linux to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is solvable in any
operating system. Even KolibriOS, probably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My friend Mentat often makes unique puzzles for me, and today was
no exception. He, armed with a devious new idea, came on IRC and
bothered me once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click on the image to enlarge]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/U29dE.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I received a DCC protocol request, as I expected. Three
files named Mentat.? Mentat2.? and Mentat3.? were sent to me. After
viewing the magic numbers of the three files, I determined 1st was
data, and the 2nd and 3rd were PNGs, so I changed the extensions to
Mentat2.png and Mentat3.png so they would open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/ayuKB.png" /&gt; &lt;img src=
"http://i.imgur.com/kBz6I.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, here's the incomplete file Mentat.?, reproduced in
plain text. Two of the characters are not representable in ASCII,
so you'll have to insert them via. a Hex Editor. Those two are
represented below by &amp;lt;8F&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;16&amp;gt;, where those are the
hex values you must need to insert in their place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font color="purple"&gt;&lt;font size=
"4"&gt;t~01!½lS­06¡§Ç-´Ágn"&amp;Dagger;¿v;=t&amp;mdash;&amp;dagger;Â&lt;font color=
"blue"&gt;&amp;lt;8F&amp;gt;&lt;/font&gt;ÿJ&amp;trade;«\&amp;#382;×=G&lt;font color=
"blue"&gt;&amp;lt;16&amp;gt;&lt;/font&gt;u¾&amp;lt;&amp;circ;¸Ï÷w&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this puzzle: just follow the instructions Mentat
gives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do as the file(1) program does, and query the file with a search
for the bytes of the magic number header you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a fully complete file, you should be able to put the 8F and
16 in with a Hex Editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using file(1) or just Googleing it should tell you the kind of
file it is, and how to run it. Of course, it's an encrypted file
with a password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The password, like Mentat says, is encoded in the two
images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;FN2ZQ47 - Final Location&lt;br /&gt;N/S  __ ° __ . ___ W/E ___ ° __ . ___ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This Cache is located near a very nice field next to cubberley community center which used to be a high school until it closed in 1979 (as very nicely corrected by Digitalfish :)). 

There was a recent change last year with the field when they removed the grass and put astro-turf instead. Astro-turf is annoying in some ways because if you put your hand on the grass these little rubber beads stick to your hand. 

You notice however that soccer games still play in the rain on this tuft!

Some information on the cache: it is not located on the grass or dirt track, no climbing or digging is needed, all you need is to be able to reach a very short grab. Fairly easy, however it will take a lot of looking around the edges and such. I HIGHLY recommend closed-toed shoes. There is some glass on the ground sometimes so be careful. Also be on the lookout for stair-running muggles. These seem to be an abundance nowadays.</groundspeak:long_description>

approach the cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your best bet is to get a good reading out in the parking lot and
then come in inbetween the two buildings until you are closest to
the cache. If that doesn't work then the hint should get you close
(using the hint will decrease the difficulty level though). 
&lt;p&gt;If you want more privacy during your search, avoid going during
the lunch or dinner hours of the nearby dining establishment. Cache
is not in the dumpster corral, no need to go there. Please be
gentle with the cache's camo. Happy caching!&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">For those of you who are fans of Battlestar Galactica the title may
remind you of the inventive way the writers skated past the FCC
language guidelines. You may be inclined to say it a few times
yourself while trying to solve this one. However, the title is just
short for Fractionated Morse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cache is an academic exercise in programming and cryptology.
It is intended to be a collaborative exercise in the logs like
GroMARK was. In fact, the log sheet is the old GroMARK log sheet.
Below is a Fractionated Morse cipher of the same type described by
Cycling Cacher in his cache of that name (GC121W2). It is
enciphered consistently with the description given by the American
Cryptogram Association (ACA)
&lt;a href="http://www.cryptogram.org/cdb/aca.info/aca.and.you/chapter_09.pdf#FRACTI"&gt;
here.&lt;/a&gt; The plaintext is in normal English with words separated
by spaces. Unlike Cycling Cacher I am not providing a crib,
although I can't stop anyone from guessing one. The key is a
phrase.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The idea is to devise a program that will solve this automatically.
As with the GroMARK hill-climbing can solve it if modified
appropriately. My hillclimber required some tweaking to solve (not
specifically designed for this text, but tweaks I would do for any
text I was having difficulty with). After tweaking it broke the
first two words and several others within the text in less than
three minutes, certainly enough to complete the job by hand if
necessary. After that I entered the two words as a crib (but
without specifying where the crib was located) and restarted it. It
solved 100% in about a half hour, so I know this is solvable in the
manner I have described. I would like to see what it takes to get
your program to solve completely, not just identify a few words. I
think it would be fun for other watchers to read of your failures
or difficulties, too. I encourage plenty of posting as long as
there are no spoilers. This cipher type is harder than most to
solve using hill-climbing. I am hoping to see every contributor
post ideas and describe their successes and failures as happened
with Gromark at the beginning. If you succeed in solving, please do
not post actual code or links to such code or, of course, the
coordinates or plaintext or physical information that would allow
for brute forcing. What I'm looking for is for a collaborative
effort to identify the characteristics of an effective Fractionated
Morse autosolver so that others can write their own. Unlike GroMARK
I do not intend to post hints that will enable solution without the
ability to write an autosolver to find it, but in my experience
there are some really smart people out there who will be able to
solve it by paper and pencil or with only minor computer use, or
maybe just brute force it.&lt;br /&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">It is the season of hard puzzles, that encouraged me to take yet another look at this one. I had previously used methods I can understand: brute force with various levels of optimizations, running the computer up to a week at a time, with possible cribs. And the fact is, it doesn't work. I tried the churn algorithm, it didn't work (maybe because of a translation mistake, see below). I understood from the logs that simulated annealing was the way to go, but I didn't really know how to implement it, and most of all I didn't know the recipe for the secret sauce: scoring.
Last week, I found the algorithm but the number of parameters is overwhelming and my sauce wasn't shaping up well. I used tetragraphs with spaces, morse correctness, dictionary look ups, likeliness of a sentence based on the number of good words in use, but that still wasn't producing anything other than "ta ti ti ta ti ta...". Then I noticed that the highest scores were suspiciously short and realized I had made a mistake by aborting translations as soon as there was a morse error instead of returning them whole, which produced a lot of short false positives with a score higher than good looking longer sentences. Once that was corrected, I ran the C++ code again and ô surprise, it decoded my test cipher! I felt pretty confident it could work on Frac, so I ran it again and 3 hours later, it generated a perfectly valid solution. Phew! The run time may seem high but I didn't want to leave any stone unturned, I guess a less than perfect approach would be shorter. There sure is some room for optimization too as I didn't use hash tables to speed up the look ups, or very crude home-made ones.
This happens to be my puzzle #2000. One of the ones I put the most effort into, and the one that strained my computer the most. It was amusing to see another me having signed the log a few years ago. At least there was no repeat.
Thanks for the challenge, at least I learned something new that could come in handy in interview questions [:)].</groundspeak:text>

Constantly less than a minute on an aged Linux machine with good old plain C and a couple of already existing, but freshly refurbished routines: SA, tetragrams with Spaces, a new scoring algorithm with positive tetragrams and penalties for non-Morse code letters, off-standard IC and too many Es, Ts and spaces. I found either one of the latter two penalties can be skipped, however convergence is better when separated. 
The initial approach was shotgun hillclimbing (SH) and non-space-containing tetragrams... I actually did find the keys with it and some manual help on the partial decrypts, but the overall performance of SH was a bit sad.

This was my first SA implementation and I love it... how could I survice that long with SH and evolutionary algorithms?  

Not sure I will ever have the chance to drop by and get the log book signed - but the two evening-fun was worth it in any case!

I had my fractionated Morse helper code from solving GC121W2, and I had my hill climbing/simulated annealing code from from the hint for "Fed Second".  All I needed to do was combine them, right?  Well...  I read the logs as they came in, but seeing that I needed a table of tetragrams with spaces I put it aside.  During a  recent conversation with Rogue Ramblers, he reminded me how much fun he had getting this to work.  So I set off again.  He offered to share his table of tetragrams with spaces, and I adapted my program.  I fought through some infamous wild pointer bugs and eventually got something that works!  I just saw real English come out!  The funny thing is that if I let it keep running, the simulated annealing will wander right off the correct peak.  And it doesn't seem to know when its done.  I might play with it some more - or was there another of Crawburr's puzzles that needs hill climbing?</groundspeak:text>

I'd had quite a lot of experience with simulated annealing and related algorithms before encountering this puzzle, so I was confident that I'd be able to follow TeamOttlet's wonderful instructions.  However, since SA has been done to death [;)] I decided to spend a good long while poking around with a more original approach I have wondered about.  (This didn't pan out for me, but I'll describe it to see if you think it has promise.  The inadequacy was most likely in implementation rather than approach.)

I hypothesized that only a small fraction of key permutations--maybe only one!--would produce 100% valid Morse code.  If that is correct, then a deterministic attack might work well on this.

Take distinct letters one by one from the start of the cipher-text: J,U,Q,N,H,O,D,Y,X...  Go depth-first search on mappings of J, then JU, then JUQ, continuing forward only if the partial mapping gives Morse code that could be the start of a valid complete message.  ('.-.x.x' good, 'xx.xx-' bad.)  Big branches of search space will be eliminated near the trunk.

I never did get this implemented satisfactorily, but would love to come back to it some day!  [:)]

Last night I finally got fed up with Frac looming, ever looming on my closest-to-home list, and slapped some bad-ass SA onto what I'd already written.  I must've gotten lucky with my temperature schedule and penalty scores, because one of my first three parallel runs came back with the solution in less than half an hour.  (And that's in Python, scoring decodes 50x slower than TeamOttlet!)

Thanks for another wonderful, marvelous puzzle.  I have a great code base now that I look forward to using on other crypto puzzles, and was inspired to try some novel things.  Keep 'em coming!  ...  Find #243.</groundspeak:text>

Built by Henry Rengstorff in 1867, it is now located inside Shoreline Park, adjacent to a lake, wetlands and bird sanctuary. (see also http://www.r-house.org)

Henry Rengstorff was born in Northern Germany. Tempted by the gold that was found in 1849 he came to the Golden State at the age of 21. Arriving too late in 1850 he decided to work on steamers and farms. With the money that he made, he bought land and established a ship landing in the South Bay that helped developing the economic growth of Mtn. View and the surrounding area.

Please visit the house and enjoy the beautiful scenery, while making a trip in the park.

The position of the cache is NOT on the property of the Rengstorff House and its garden.
You have to find a tool first in order to remove the cache out of its hiding place. Once you have found either the cache or the tool you are close to finding the counterpart. (see hint below)

The place is very popular with visitors, especially on nice and sunny days. Nevertheless it is easy to hide once you have retrieved the cache. :-) That is also one reason why I had the idea with the tool.

Enjoy and give me feedback on my first hidden cache. I hope you like it.

The original content were all little kids toys and lots of "golden" coins.</groundspeak:long_description>

Didn't find or need any tool to retrieve the cache, so it was quite a quick grab. Geosense took me right to it. Dropped off Better To Be Lucky geocoin. Sadly, right after we found the cache, we walked toward the lake and saw a "no dogs allowed" sign, so we had to turn around and head home. Oh well... TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This year some very popular shows went off the air.
&lt;i&gt;Friends&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Frasier&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;The Practice&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Angel&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;i&gt;Ed&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you may have watched these finales, you may not have
noticed that they all contained some numbers encoded in the closed
captioning. In fact, not only were there numbers in the final
episodes, but there were numbers in a bunch of their episodes
leading up to the finale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network executives saw opportunities for huge ad dollars for
the airings of these finales, so they made sure that anyone could
watch them and "get it" without having seen a single episode
before. With my trusty TiVo I was able to go through each of the
episodes leading up to the finale and grab all the encoded
numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Angel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
8 6 12 16 26&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ed&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
9 12 7 10 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Frasier&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2 8 3 27 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Friends&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3 2 4 4 8 16&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
4 7 15 29 59&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Practice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2 3 5 7 11 13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very strange. After watching the finales, I placed a cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N37 (Ed + 16) . (Frasier * 4) + (Friends * 5) + 9&lt;br /&gt;
W122 (The Practice - 16) . (Angel * 3) + (Sex and the City) + 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container is a small tupperware bin. Bring a pen.With all
these shows gone, my TiVo will be positively bored next fall. Oh
wait, maybe there'll be reruns...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Like most good puzzles, this made no sense the first time I saw it but after looking again I Finale (!) saw some light. I was able to determine 5/6 of the answers without problems, but Friends created problems for me as it did in the past for others (I never liked that show anyway). Was able to iterate my way to a solution with the help of Google Maps and then effectively confirm it by reviewing past logs.

Found GZ easily enough in the dark, and found not 1, but 2 containers, a few feet apart!  The older container had the cracked lid mentioned, with nothing inside but an old cache notice and the *original* logbook. The newer container was placed earlier this year (4/11) and had a brand new logbook and a few green aliens for company. I salvaged the original logbook, cleaned off some dirt (it was dry), and signed the new log, putting them both into the new ziploc and container.  I added a GC notice label on the new container's lid, and took the cracked old container away for recycling.  Finally, I traded some silly bands (all I had) for a green alien.  Thanks to the anonymous cacher who provided the new log and container, and thanks to Boulter who created the puzzle and rated it as a 4/1, allowing me to bag another D/T square!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Even though I noticed something interesting about this puzzle early on, which turned out to be key, it took me the longest time to finally catch on to how to get started.  Several times I considered asking for additional guidance, but after the 'Aha!' moment was glad I hadn't.  By that time the puzzle had become more difficult, so after hitting a wall I wrote some code to collect additional data.  Given the puzzle construction even that was going to take a prohibitively long period of time on a few data points.  Eventually I found all but one, and after getting no reply from the CO asked a previous solver for the last one.  Given how the puzzle has become more difficult, IMO it could be improved and made more accessible to future solvers by making just a few small changes.  Thanks for another interesting challenge.</groundspeak:text>

After some pretty hard work, I was able to hash out just enough data to please the CO enough to reward me with more data.  The second part was pretty simple, due to a habit I have while working on puzzles, so I picked it up pretty quickly.  A very inspirational puzzle!  I always enjoy when someone can take an everyday occurrence and create a new way of looking at it.

When Gitonyerhorse mentioned that she was looking at this one, I decided it was time to take another look. This time I was able to find a piece of info that hinted that I might be able to find more if I searched harder. Soon, I had four of the seven pieces, but I was not having any success retrieving the remaining three. So, I decided to brute-force, and I found two more, which was enough to get me the coords. Not sure how I missed the last one. There were two ways I should have found it, but mokelly gave me the info after the fact. Stopped by and spent 15 minutes finding the cache. Mostly because there were a couple pairs of muggles in the area, and because I just wasn't searching the right spots. I moved to another spot for a while (which I just noticed has an odd inconsistency with its seating area), but eventually I returned to the right location and found the cache as one of the pairs was leaving.

&lt;p&gt;Being both pious and loyal, Friar Tuck ran to warn Robin Hood.
He found his way hurriedly but stealthily through Sherwood Forest
until he espied Robin sitting on a log, quaffing a cup of rum with
Maid Marian as she poured from a larger vessel. "Robin," quoth he,
"Come quickly, for Little John goes toe to toe with a band of
several armed minions of the Sheriff of Nottingham!" "Luv," cried
Robin to Maid Marian, "Soap! Grab that bar and the rum, too, and
let us make haste." Perplexed, she followed his order, lifting her
skirts with her left hand to race behind him, rum sloshing in the
bowl she held in the other. As Robin reached the clearing where
Little John, using only his quarterstaff, was trying to fight off
the Sheriff's men, all wielding broadswords, he stopped and
whispered, "Indeed, savagely are they going toe to ... wait! ... Do
not brood. I have an idea." With that he made a lather with the
ingredients he had brought, smeared it around the muzzle of his
trusty hound Quiver, who had followed in the chase, and set the dog
upon the men. Fearing the bite of a rabid hound they all fled
except Little John, who slumped down and sat breathless, unable
even to utter a word. "Speak, man," said Robin, "Are you all right?
Here, this will cure your strep throat." He handed Little John the
hearty drink. Friar Tuck and Maid Marian broke into laughter and
joined the toast celebrating the easy victory over the evil Sheriff
once again.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I looked at this one over the course of many months, without a clue as to how to approach it. [8)] I had some ideas but didn't see how the hints fit in (and there is one I still don't understand at all).  Thanks to thelins, who put the bow in my hand and shoved me down the trail, I joined the hunt and was soon toe to toe with Nottingham's men. [}:)]  I made it through the forest with only a slight amount of scathing but then discovered, as I tried to certify, that I had forgotten one thing. [B)]  Back into the forest I went to search for that one thing until, at last, I was able to sit and drink rum with the other merry men and women who had made it through the forest before me. [:D]

Stopped by on my way into work this morning and made the quick find. Felt a bit like there were eyes on me so was thankful that I didn't have to hunt longer.

Thanks Mr. Rat for another challenge.</groundspeak:text>

Yesterday I was checking a few of the local impossipuzzles to see if there was anything new and noticed the hints had expanded.  This time my very first guess as to the encoding scheme proved to be correct, although it was a struggle to prove it.  I eventually whomped up a little program to do the work and was most pleased to see coordinates appear.  Stopped off today on a bicycle caching run to sign the log.  TFTP</groundspeak:text>

In the end, I'm grateful Winterwolfe gave me a nudge, as I had gotten myself so deeply lost in the forest, I could no longer see the trees. In fact, I can see quite clearly in retrospect that for a variety of reasons, tarrying longer on my own could not have saved me. It still took me quite awhile to find that which I sought, yet once I'd caught a glimpse of the infamous Lincoln green, I was more than willing to engage in the chase -- huzzah!

 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Bullit recently archived his nearby Camino Skylights cache and
was kind enough to let me take over this area. No need to check any
vegetation and no need to go upslope for this one. 5/28/09: To
prevent further woodchip slides I'll give a hint: cache is within 4
or 5' of paved trail. Note: The overhead power lines sometimes will
make accurate GPS readings difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view the skylights, follow the trail into the tunnel, under
the bridge. About half way across the tunnel look up. These
skylights have panes and were installed right into the median on El
Camino Real above. The skylights took nearly a year to complete and
the cost to build this section of the trail was $3.5 million.
During construction builders had to contend with the 204,000 cars
per day passing by on El Camino above as they were not permitted to
close the road. In addition, all of the utility lines running along
El Camino had to be dug up and reburied under the new trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking is available at nearby stores or at a little lot
adjacent to one of the Stevens Creek trailheads, this one located
at the end of Yuba Drive at N 37 22.939 W122 04.118. Not only is
this section open but yet another extension on the Stevens Creek
(south of El Camino) opened up last week. The trail now goes all
the to Sleeper Avenue. Come check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/10/09:Congratulations to Wildbun and jasmerb on FTF!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

The back section here is def a transient ex camp and now dump; old clothes, couch, junk laying around.  Lots of various landscaping stuff too.  

I could not find it in any of the "usual suspect" spots.  I was not about to start reaching around underneath the wooden structure since this is black widow and snake habitat supreme.  

If this is buried under the trash/clothes or tree rubble I'll be out of luck...there's just too much of it. Will try again tomorrow.

Edit:  went back this morning (July 11).  I DNF'd and was rather thorough.  There is def a transient in the area although some of the clothing and materials here appear to have been there a month or so.  The lockbox in the pictures is intact.

&lt;br /&gt;
The coordinates above are the starting point of a journey
consisting of 25 legs and each leg consists of a series of half
circles.&amp;nbsp; Each half circle begins and ends somewhere alone a
line of constant latitude or longitude.&amp;nbsp; Each half circle is a
continuation of the preceding half circle but its center will move
as its radius changes. &amp;nbsp;The following figure illustrates how
the first five half circles are laid out in the first leg. &amp;nbsp;
(Please note that the figure is not in scale.)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
For any of the given legs, the radius of both first and second half
circles are equal, designated by R and changes according to the
following well known sequence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
R/1, R/1, R/2 ...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each leg has a direction, consists of a different number of half
circles and when completed will have a specified amount of
circumferential distance traveled. &amp;nbsp; These parameters will
vary according to the following partial table.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

After the first leg, which begins at the listed coordinates, each
subsequent leg begins at the point where the previous leg ended and
you can expect to find the cache at the end of the last leg. &amp;nbsp;

Updated 10-14-05. The finders have given a mixed report on how hard
this is to find. This cache is located on church property with the
permission of the Pastor who lives on the property. The facilities
are used by a number of groups many of whom are not aware of the
cache, but because you are looked at with interest does not mean
you should not proceed using the usual caution for muggles.</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Look down not up!


If you you still can't find it.  Look for the painted stripe on the concrete curb.  Shuffle around in the leaves and dirt about 12 inches from the curb.  It is there.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Team Ottlet&lt;/a&gt; for his part in inspiring this puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In electronics &amp;ldquo;digital&amp;rdquo; refers to a circuit that
operates in discrete states usually described as logic 1 or 0. To
create a &amp;ldquo;digital&amp;rdquo; circuit transistors are arranged in
configurations that when switched on or off to pass the power
supply voltage (logic 1) or ground (logic 0) to the output. These
configurations create logic gates that perform logical functions
such as NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, TGATES and combinations of
such. Other useful discrete circuits are latches and flip-flops.
Latches and flops are special logic functions that can store values
and act like single bit memories, but they are in fact comprised of
the logic gates mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s say that a circuit designer needs a four bit
counter. He can draw a schematic of such a circuit like this.&lt;/p&gt;

alt="Synchronous Counter" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if he needs a 64 bit counter or an up/down,
programmable, or mod N counter? The designer would have to spend a
lot more time figuring out which combinations of logic gates were
needed between the flip-flops to get the desired function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important piece of technology that helped fuel our current
digital revolution was the hardware description language. There are
two main-stream languages today, Verilog and VHDL. A hardware
description language allows the circuit designer to describe the
behavior of a circuit. Then EDA (Electronic Design Automation)
tools are used to determine the optimal configuration of logic
gates to achieve the desired function. This makes circuit design
fast and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the circuit pictured above can be described in
Verilog as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
module counter4(clock,enable,Q,output_carry);
input clock;
input enable;
output [3:0] Q;
output output_carry;
reg [3:0] Q;
reg enable; 
reg carry_out; 
always@(posedge clock) begin
    if (enable=1&amp;rsquo;b1) 
        Q&amp;lt;=Q+1;
end
always@(Q or enable) begin
    if (enable==1&amp;rsquo;b1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Q==4&amp;rsquo;b111)
        output_carry&amp;lt;=1;
    else
        output_carry&amp;lt;=0;
end
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I need to turn this into a 64 bit counter or add some other
feature I can very quickly change the description. But if I had to
sit and redraw the schematic it would take more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find this cache you will need to determine the output of the
circuit which is described in Verilog below. Assume that the
circuit has just come out of the reset state. Also assume that the
clock signal, ck, is a typical clock signal that toggles between 1
and 0 in a square wave. You should have coordinates in 16 clock
cycles. The coordinate check sum is 49.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
module secretcoords(ck,rst,out);
   input ck,rst;   
   output [3:0]  out;
   reg [0:15]    lfsr;
   parameter [0:15] init = 16'hFFFF;

   end

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I saw this one come out, but never had the patience to sit down and do what's required. While recovering recently from a non-geocaching related incident, I had the time, and decided to do it by converting it to another language I am more familiar in. TNS convinced me to try it in Verilog, however, and even recommended a tool to use. With his encouragement and offer to help if I get stuck, I read up on some online tutorials, installed the necessary software, and went at it. To my surprise, my first attempt kinda-sorta worked for the latitude, but longitude was a mess. A little experimenting showed me that certain functions don't work as I expect them to, but rather in a way that made sense for the purpose of this language, and from there I got coordinates. Of course, it didn't help that Certitude was down the whole of that day [:)] TNS helped by explaining to me some of the details of what I did - just because it works doesn't mean that I understand all of it [:)]

Came by today for a walk and to sign the log on this one. GPSr was a little finicky, so took a while before I found the cache. Not being able to bend didn't help [:)] I remember being stumped by the first 2 Circuit Theory, maybe it is time to revisit them. Thanks for the education (and a special thanks to TNS for his help) and thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Although not an excuse to ignore a good puzzle, I simply skipped over this one since the CO puzzle finals are either in Livermore or Canada. At the [url=http://coord.info/GC2PPAP]FINAL ACTIVITY EVENT 2011[/url], the CO mentioned that this puzzle was in the South Bay so I didn't have an excuse this time [:)]. Fortunately I knew exactly what to do the first time that I looked at it but the biggest hurdle was finding a tool that ran on Windows since I didn’t have access to a Unix machine. I ended up using a windows port of one that flew too close to the sun [;)]. Although it’s been a few years (about 15 to be exact) since I last wrote any Verilog code, once I administered CPR to the old brain cells it didn’t take too long until I had the coordinates sitting in a DOS window on my computer monitor.
On the way into work/to the cache this AM, I passed an in-theme business where I learned to simulate a Verilog/VHDL description while trying very hard not to create latches [:I]. At the final location, I found the cache the first place I checked [:D]. Although I have solved a couple of other CO puzzles, including the one in Saskatchewan, this is the first cache that I found by this CO. It’s certainly a strange coincidence since the CO made his first find of any of my puzzles two days ago. I gave this cache a favorite vote for the unique and creative implementation but be advised that this is definitely a puzzle that is relatively easy for some and could be a steep learning curve for others. Thanks for the fun puzzle that proves there’s more to life than SPICE [:)]. This cache fills in one of the 65 missing days on my Finds for each Day of the year. TNLNSL TFTC #846</groundspeak:text>

but it is within a mile. Do not attempt to go to the posted

page to determine the coordinates of the cache.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The information needed to solve the puzzle must be available to
the general caching community and the puzzle should be solvable
from the information provided on the cache page."
~Geocaching.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had this idea for a puzzle cache for a while, and wanted to
make it my first puzzle. The puzzle can be as simple as you make
it. I suspect some will solve the puzzle fairly quickly, and for
others it will take ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many puzzles have "Aha!" moments. Some puzzles have "Aha!"
moments as to when you figure out what the puzzle actually is. In
this case, those two moments are the same moment. (I could have
made this puzzle a LOT harder.) But I chose not to. The puzzle is
one that everyone can solve, regardless of whether or not you're in
the ACA, or in High School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go along with this puzzle, I of course needed to hide a
cache. But when I hide a cache, the hide is often so clever that I
just make it a Traditional hide so as to have as many people as
possible look for it! This cache is no exception. It is well
hidden, and not just another "You solved my puzzle, so the cache is
an easy find under a lamppost."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficulty of this cache is based on the puzzle AND the
hide. The cache is visible from the north, but only obtainable from
the south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing. I could not think of a name for this cache. In
your log, suggest what you think I should name it! (But don't
forget to put some substance into your log too!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;table border="1" width="75%"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="100%"&gt;Back in the day, I used to read "Choose your own
adventure" books.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps you remember these stories, in
which YOU were the main character (an elf, or a troll, etc).&amp;nbsp;
As the reader, you would be faced with a decision every few
pages.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes, your decisions would result in a fairy tale
ending; other times, your choices would lead to your death. Like
the choose your own adventure books, this cache has been placed to
let YOU decide where it is! 
&lt;p&gt;But it won't be so easy.&amp;nbsp; In any adventure, there must be
some strife.&amp;nbsp; You're going to have to do some work before you
reach your fairy tale ending.&amp;nbsp; Have a fun adventure along the
way!&amp;nbsp; Bring your own pen; this is a sign only micro.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the muggle, the coordinates were in a logical order
(A,B,C,D,E,F... etc) Since the cache has been relocated, the cache
coordinates are in the following format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NORTH 37° AM.DEL WEST 122° CG.KLA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal Parking with the shortest safe walk (about 0.15 miles) is
at the following location:&lt;/p&gt;
NORTH 37° AM.DKM WEST 122° FM.DDK 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;ANY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; number from 1 to 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiply your selected number by the number 999,999&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide this result by 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take the digits of the result and rearrange them lowest (left)
to highest (right)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The digits now correspond to the following letters:&lt;br&gt;
 K A B L I J&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;ANY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; number from 1 through 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down the name of your chosen number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Count the number of letters in the name of your number to
obtain a second number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Count the number of letters in the second number to obtain a
third&amp;nbsp; number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Count the number of letters in the third number to obtain a
fourth number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep doing this for a while until you get really bored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number that you finally stop on corresponds to G&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 3:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down your 7 digit phone number (Works best for USA
residents - others may select 7 random digits).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down the number 8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiply your 7 digit phone number by 8, and write down the
result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now you have a lot of individual digits written down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add up the sum of &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; these digits, and you will obtain
a new number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the new number contains more than one digit, then add up the
digits of the new number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep doing this until you have a one digit number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you have one digit left, add the number one (1).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result corresponds to D.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 4:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take any 21 cards out of a normal card deck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deal three cards face up in a horizontal row. Continue dealing
three cards across, overlapping the cards so that they are all
visible, until you have three vertical columns of seven cards
each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the cards spread out like this, and choose your
&lt;b&gt;FAVORITE&lt;/b&gt; card (don't forget it!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Square up the columns one at a time (without disarranging their
order) and assemble them in your hand so that the pile with your
favorite card is between the other two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deal the cards across again into three columns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look to see where your selected card appears.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As in step 4, assemble the deck with the pile that contains
your selected card between the other two piles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat steps 5 through 7 once more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, flip the deck over so that the backs of the cards are
facing you (Cards should have been face up during this whole
procedure).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking from the top of the stack, flip the cards over
one-by-one revealing their faces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Count the cards as you do this.&amp;nbsp; If your card is the first
card you turn over, then then enter 1 into the following
equation.&amp;nbsp; If your card is the 5th card you turn over, then
enter 5 into the following equations etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;H = (the position of your card) - 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E = H / 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C = F = E - 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M = J - 5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I had an adventure somewhere else when I DNFd the cache final owing to some quirky coordinates that I came up with.  Today, with the right arrangement and the company of Rachell, the cache was quickly found.  Opening it was a little sticky, although we had the right information with us.  I suspect water has gotten into the mechanism over time.  The log was jammed into the space in tatters and we had to pick them out one by one, finally finding a couple with some space left to sign our names.  We removed some of the gummed-together balls of paper to make more room inside.  Hopefully the next visitor will come prepared with a small piece of paper to add to the collection.  All the while, passing muggles paid us absolutely no mind.

Overall, this ended up being more of an adventure than anticipated but fun all the same.  Thanks for the puzzle!</groundspeak:text>

I went to bed, got a good nights sleep and looked at it again in the morning. This time the coords came quickly and correctly.

Met up with TheGirlsFromPA after work and walked out to GZ together. We headed to the right place and the cache was immediately apparent as we walked up. What a cute idea!  We were prepared and were able to access the log which was almost completely disintegrated.  We managed to find a couple of pieces with blank space, signed one and put both back so that the next person could sign on the other.  Too bad we didn't have any supplies with us to replace the log.  Maybe the next finder can bring something.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;A popular puzzle type that I haven't used in some time is an
instructional cipher puzzle. This one is the Route Cipher as used
in the American Cryptogram Association (ACA) (except my rectangle
is bigger than indicated in the ACA guidelines). There is nothing
particularly tricky about it, but it can be quite a bit of work to
solve, especially by paper and pencil. There are exactly 48 routes
allowed in the ACA: rows, columns, diagonals and spirals. Spirals
can be clockwise or counterclockwise, and can start in a corner or
near the center. The others can alternate directions (like a snake
or "S" path). Here is a description of the cipher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=
"http://www.cryptogram.org/cdb/aca.info/aca.and.you/chapter_09.pdf#ROUTE"&gt;
ACA cipher type: Route&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have appropriately started you at the intersection of Route 85
and Route 82. Solve the Route cipher below and find the cache. In
order to solve it you must first reverse the route used to take off
the ciphertext. This means first guessing the dimensions of the
rectangle. There are several possibilities. Unless you are a
programmer who can knock out the code to brute force all
rectangle/route possibilities, you have to start trying by writing
out the text in various routes in the rectangle you have guessed.
The best way to solve a Route is to use a "crib," i.e. a known word
in the plaintext, to verify whether the route and rectangle you
chose allow for reading the crib via a separate route. I'll give
you a head start. The message in the cipher below contains the word
FIVE. That's your crib. There is only one V in the ciphertext. So
when you start writing the ciphertext into the rectangle, when you
come to the V, continue to fill in the rectangle until you have
filled in all the squares adjacent to the V. If the adjacent
letters do not contain an I and an E then that cannot be the right
route/rectangle combination because the word FIVE cannot be read
out from that V horizontally, vertically, diagonally, or in a
spiral. You can stop and try another route or rectangle size. If
there is an adjacent I and E then you have to check the letters
adjacent to the I to see if there is an F that follows one of the
accepted routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the ciphertext:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Nylimb on the FTS. Since this isn't getting
the usual rush of solutions, I'll add another tip. Every route has
a valid reciprocal route that begins at the end point and follows
the same route back to the first letter in the first square. This
means you can begin at either end of the ciphertext when writing
the letters into the rectangle. Starting at the end here will get
you to the V sooner and thus reduce the amount of writing necessary
to eliminate a bad route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I wasn’t familiar with this ACA cipher but it didn’t take much effort to come up to speed. The easiest part was figuring out the possible rectangle sizes [:)]. The next step(s) took a bit more work. I noticed something interesting in the ciphertext and used this characteristic to look for the crib. It took a few iterations to work out the dimensions of the rectangle. I left a favorite vote since I learned something new and had fun in the process [^]. Finding the cache was simply a matter of adjusting my weekday “route” [;)]. Thanks for a fun puzzle that was easier than it initially appeared, but it’s probably that I just got lucky [:D]. This was the 9th CO puzzle that I found in the last ten days.

"No, sweetie, no puzzles. Why?"&lt;br /&gt;
"I want to learn to do puzzles, just like you!"&lt;br /&gt;
"Well, I have good news; you're already doing puzzles. Like when we go to restaurants, and you work on the games that are on the menu."&lt;br /&gt;
"Are those like grown-up puzzles?"&lt;br /&gt;
"Umm...not exactly. They're similar, but grown-up ones usually have some tricky part to them that makes them harder. Don't worry; just keep practicing, and you'll do fine."&lt;br /&gt;
"Yay, yay, yay!!! Mama...I love you."&lt;br /&gt;

Alto.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">One of us grew up in this historic Eichler enclave eons ago and
thought it deserved a cache. There is a community park complete
with swimming pool nearby the cache location. To learn more about
this neighborhood go to: &lt;a rel="nofollow"
href="http://www.paloaltoonline.com/neighborhoods/greenmeadow.shtml"&gt;
Greenmeadow, Palo Alto&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;p&gt;Although the cache is fairly small, it is not a blinker and it
is not attached to any plant matter or on private property. It is
not in the fence post caps. No climbing or excavation is required
to access the cache. This is a sign-only micro. If you manage to
put anything into the cache, we'd like to hear about it. Bring a
pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area is easily accessible and has convenient parking on the
street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be very careful when retrieving and replacing the
cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;05/22/2004 5:40 P.M. - Increased difficulty level to 4 due to
feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;05/15/2007 9:00 P.M. - Changed the cache and the location since
virtualdavid pretty much gave the cache container type and location
away in his log. All previous logs and hints are now useless. You
can thank him if you think it's tougher now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;05/22/2007 9:30 P.M. - You can log this cache a second time *IF*
you have found it before 05/22/2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;06/14/2007 5:30 P.M. - Increased the difficulty rating from 4.0
to 4.5 due to feedback and added another hint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;05/17/2009 2:30 P.M. Due to some recent architectural changes to
the environment at GZ, we had to relocate the cache a short
distance away. Again. We could have left the cache at its previous
location, but the terrain rating would have increased from 1.0 to
4.0. We think it will be easier to find at its new location.
However... If it appears that the cache no longer qualifies as a
4.5 difficulty hide, we have two more hide styles in mind that will
definitely be at least as challenging if not more so.&lt;/p&gt;

Finally made the find after multiple visits to GZ (only two of which I officially logged as DNFs) and an unmentionable amount of times I've driven down Charleston, contemplating making an attempt but being discouraged by a previous unsuccessful visit. As is, DREsax and I ended up visiting this cache twice today (the second time with tagalongs thelastshaun and geocaching newbie Hayley) and it took our full search effort (both times!) to come up with the find. Moreover, after our first bout of searching, we seemed to have discovered a red herring which sent us down the wrong path for a good 15 mins during the second visit before DREsax eventually gave me that look, indicating that she had come up with the find. Ahhhhhhh, what a relief to finally be able to check this one off the list and, most importantly, remove it from my "Want to find" list on my phone.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Special Notes about the 2011 Puzzle Challenge:&lt;/b&gt; To be considered for Fastest Solver points, you must verify your solution with &lt;a href="http://certitude.comxa.com/certitude.php?wp=GC36ZYN"&gt;certitude&lt;/a&gt;. Because certitude may not properly account for joint solutions, please email me team member names in the case of team solutions to ensure proper point accounting. All "point" scoring is arbitrary anyway, subject to change, at the discretion of the cache owner, and probably completely meaningless (unless you just want to be able to brag more at the December banquet). The real challenge is just to see whether you can solve all of these caches by the end of the year. To maintain fairness, hints should not be offered by the cache owner or other solvers until the fifteenth of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Special Notes about this month's puzzle:&lt;/b&gt; A little bigger than the typical microcache, but still not big enough to hold a real logbook.&lt;/p&gt;

I really had a heck of time with the KPC challenge in 2011 and wasn't terribly motivated to go find them.   Today I found myself with loads of spare time and passing nearby so I detoured to make an attempt.   As I parked I realized that I had only been here once before when I was training for a half marathon.  It was pretty hot out today but that didn't seem to deter many runners that were out on the trail today.   Thanks for the fun.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;Recently I was struggling with Rogue Ramblers' &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=3fb25956-b188-47ac-97a0-f1693c3d6c2c"&gt;
"A Test"&lt;/a&gt;. It felt as if this was a test I would surely fail.
Thankfully it turned out that my success was simply &lt;a href=
"http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/men/news/education/s/166/166470_exam_failure_equals_deferred_success.html"&gt;
"deferred"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often while I work on puzzles I come up with other possibilities
for puzzles. This is one of them. Just like "A Test", there's only
some simple substitution going on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;67 - 542 - 23 - 67 - 222 - 543 - 542 - 89&lt;br&gt;
7 - 23 - 23 - 707 - 222 - 707 - 707 - 606 - 178&lt;/p&gt;
The cache is a film can near a place you might be able to get some
help if only you didn't need the coordinates first! 
&lt;p&gt;So don't worry if you fail at this test - it's merely deferred
success.&lt;/p&gt;

I still do not know the intended solution or the theme of the puzzle, so I'm still deferring the success. Rachell's log helped me to try something, and I got something which worked out by luck, though. [:I] I left home little earlier before meeting friends to grab some puzzles, and this was the first one of the day. TFTC!

He and I were attempting to solve A Test, when he mentioned this cache.  We set out to solve this puzzle, because it seemed to have some logic to the encoding that A Test was not yielding to us yet.  Shortly we had plausible coordinates, but we were not sure they were correct.  A few days later, dj's had conformed our coords with mokelly.  This weekend we headed down here and made the find rather quickly.  Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">There have been more than one encounter story recently so I thought I would share our own.  This happened in our first year, so about 4 years ago.  In our quest to log a cache every day we found ourselves about eleven thirty PM with no cache for the day.  We were at a cache by the far back parking lot with the Vallco sign.  At night with no flashlights, the boys wouldn't have been much help looking probably for a nano, and stayed in the warm truck.  We frantically searched all over the sign, nearby area and plants.  I expanded our search all over the hillside.  We had the entire area to ourselves, but weren't able to locate this evil micro.  We were about ready to move on to try another cache.  A police officer who had spotted our truck, directed his spot light at us.  The two of us stood there like the proverbial deer in the headlights.  We told him we were geocaching, which luckily he had heard of.  It was his Wish to help, so he directed his light to the roof of a small building and suggested something up there might be it.  We knew that wouldn't be it and quit the search to dash to another cache to keep our daily streak alive.  While others have tried to help, that particular memory persists with us as our first.  Peace officers regardless of the area have dealt with us as harmless crazies.  Some have tried to help, while others have urged us to leave the area.  There are lots of other stories out there with lots more juicy details, but this leads to a cache.  Please share your story?

Additional Waypoints
</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Ignore extra digits  
[The location is muggle prone which is why this is a puzzle. 
I had some effective camo planned, but decided to leave it obvious.]  
There is no need to be in an unsafe location while searching for this and signing.  (This hint should indicate there are obvious dangers to be considered in our surroundings.  Be aware of them, be safe while searching, and don't do anything foolish.  I wouldn't send my kids alone to grab this cache, but I might hold their hand throughout the search until we were back to our car.)       
[If you think this is under rated, remember the scale is from (1 nice and easy) to (5 nearly impossible).</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">We encountered a little difficulty in solving the puzzle but we overcame that.  Today, we found the cache and felt lucky not to have encountered the law given where we parked.  Recently, we were cruising slowly through a Google parking lot, counting down the feet to a puzzle final.  Once stopped, it was but a minute before the roving security guard came and asked "are you ladies employees?"  It was nice of us to call us ladies, I guess, since we were ignoring the private property signs.  We explained what we were up to and he just said that they hadn't told him there were geocaches on the property. "Oh, yes, we said.  Google has them all over the place!"  He left us to search.  He clearly wasn't worried about a couple of kooky middle-aged "ladies" might be up to.  Thanks for the puzzle.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So many stories! I had recently just finished reading about another encounter when I came across this one, and indeed, I've had a few of my own. Aside from the many "Uh, can I help you?" curious muggles, I have been questioned by police at a tree ("Recapturing my youth, sir."), questioned by ski patrol at Squaw ("Dropped my handkerchief, sir."), and questioned again by police on the side of the road ("Ok, ok, I'm geocaching. I'm really sorry.").

In fact, at the final location today, after initially exploring the option I perceived to be much safer, I thought my second more sketchy search might draw some unwanted attention. Thankfully, the cache turned up in the first spot I checked, and after signing the log, I hightailed it outta there!</groundspeak:text>

Story, hmmm, there have been a few but one that comes to mind right now is possibly my first encounter, caching anway, on Jan 10,2004. I was looking for Under the Boardwalk in Santa Cruz. I got 'busted' by a Ranger, but he knew about geocaching and this cache and got out of his truck to look. He hung around until he got a call then left. I found it about 5 minutes later.

The cache is a camo-taped pill bottle.

Update: congrats to winini for his 10,000th FTF! (OK, slight exaggeration). Also, I bumped the difficulty to 1.5, as it seems finders are hiding it better than I did.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;strong&gt;About this Preserve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
55 Acres | 0.5 Miles of Trails&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A birder's paradise, Stevens Creek Shoreline Nature Study Area, located adjacent to Mountain View's Shoreline Park, offers a 1/2-mile trail where visitors may spot pied-billed grebes, great blue herons, coots, and shovelers. The lucky visitor may even spot a clapper rail or a salt marsh harvest mouse, two endangered species that depend on this sensitive habitat to survive. Visit the &lt;a href="http://www.openspace.org/preserves/pr_stevens_creek.asp" target="_blank"&gt;preserve page&lt;/a&gt; for detailed information about preserve uses, accessibility, and amenities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Instructions for the "Preserve Circuit Geo-Challenge"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obtain a Preserve Circuit Geo-Challenge ("Preserve Circuit") Passport. You can have one mailed to you, pick one up in person at the District’s administrative office, or download an alternate .pdf version online at &lt;a href="http://www.openspace.org/geocaching" target="_blank"&gt;www.openspace.org/geocaching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.geocaching.com&lt;/a&gt;, register for a free basic membership, and obtain the GPS coordinates for the Preserve Circuit geocaches ("caches"). Search by user name "MROSD". You can also get the coordinates by using the hyperlinks at &lt;a href="http://www.openspace.org/geocaching/preserve_circuit.asp" target="_blank"&gt;www.openspace.org/preserve_circuit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start your search to locate the Preserve Circuit caches using your GPS-enabled device. A small number of GPS devices are available for loan through the District.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring water (and food for longer excursions), dress in layers, wear sturdy footwear, and take a preserve map with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search smart! Use your GPS device for guidance only; keep your eyes on the terrain as you walk! Don't put your hands where you can’t see; use a stick or similar object to search around objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you find a Preserve Circuit cache, sign the log book and stamp your passport with the unique stamp specific for that preserve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are often small items for trade located in the caches; if you take something, leave something of equal or greater value. (Do NOT remove the game piece stamp from the cache!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share your experiences online when you get home. Log into your geocaching.com account and track all of the caches you’ve found. Let us know in your log if you’re a first time visitor to any of the preserves!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#666633;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Earn Prizes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For children 16 years and younger, stamp any 12 of the Preserve Circuit cache locations in your passport with the corresponding cache stamp and receive a limited custom District cache tag.*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For geocachers of all ages, complete the entire Preserve Circuit Geo-Challenge (have every preserve cache location stamped) and receive a limited custom geocoin.*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span class="style1"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;To Redeem Prizes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For age verification purposes, cache tags must be redeemed in person, see contact information below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geocoins can be redeemed via mail or in person. You may mail in your qualifying passport (keep a copy for your records, the District is not responsible for lost mail) and receive it back along with your geocoin or make arrangements in advance to bring your passport in person to receive your geocoin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* Prizes are available while supplies last. Please visit &lt;a href="http://www.openspace.org/preserve_circuit" target="_blank"&gt;www.openspace.org/preserve_circuit&lt;/a&gt; to check the status of prize supplies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Ok.  I admit it, I am the geofriend that asked BearTerritory about this puzzle.  Like so many others, I noticed that little thing right off but then I failed to make the (easy and short) leap to the next step.  I found myself wondering how CBF could solve it so quickly when I was struggling so.  BT recommended that I go take another look at that "little" thing and WAM!, it hit me upside the head so hard that I am still seeing angels and stars! Clever, clever.  Left me wondering, how DID he do that?

Was in the area for a lunch meeting today and decided to head over to GZ for the find.  Once I found my way through all of the construction, the find was relatively easy (except for the illegal parking part), thanks to the generous hint.  I had the place all to myself which was nice as I signed the log and returned the cache to its nice hiding place.

Thanks for the fun one!

And, YES! I do love to make Homer dance!......and dance!........and dance!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">According to Certitude, I solved this back in January, but failed to add it to my "now go find it" queue.  After receiving a poke from a geofriend regarding my approach on this one, I realized that I had a solved puzzle close enough to fill a calendar square.  Hoorah!  Surely this is a sign to go get it.  Thanks to the hint, the hide was relatively straightforward, although recover/replacement had to be timed between lunchtime strollers.  Thanks for the fun puzzle.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was chatting with the CO at yesterday’s un-event about this puzzle. I told him what I had been focusing on and my interpretation of the information. He replied that my observation was irrelevant and apologized for the unintentional red-herring. As soon as I got home I decided to follow up on something that I noticed early on and Homer danced a short time later [:D]. I stopped by the final location early in the morning on my way into work. Apparently it wasn’t early enough as the immediate area was a bee hive of activity. I stopped back on my way home, parked nearby and (thanks to the generous hide hint) found the cache the first place that I checked. I can see how this puzzle would be easy for some people and more difficult for others; unfortunately I fell into the latter group [:(]. Thanks for a unique puzzle.

TeamJiffy. No comet code.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Ganymede is the largest moon of our solar system, with a diameter
of 3300 miles (compare Earth at 8000 miles).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was first seen by Galileo about 400 years ago, through the then
newly invented telescope. He observed Jupiter against a background
of several close at hand, uniquely lined up stars. He expected
Jupiter to revolve through and leave the star pattern the next
night. Instead, they still stuck with Jupiter, yet in a different
linear pattern. After several nights of this, Galileo realized they
were moons orbiting another celestial body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Until that day, the Earth was the only known divine body, with all
objects in the sky revolving around it. That was the Aristotelian
view, held as doctrine by Church authorities. With knowledge of a
second center of heavenly motion, Galileo challenged the Church.
Easy to guess what happened next: Lucy, you got some
&amp;lsquo;splaining to do.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=
"http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/Things/jupiter_satellites.html"&gt;
(visit link)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ganymede was imaged and measured by the space probe Galileo in
1996. NASA Ames Research Center was associated with the project.
The moon showed surprising surface ice tectonic patterns. Unusual
for a moon, it was found to have an iron core and a magnetic
field.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=
"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/moons/ganymede.html"&gt;(visit
link)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This moon was named for the son of the King of Troy, the most
beautiful of all mortals in Greek mythology. He was carried off by
the gods, &amp;lsquo;That he might fill the cup of Zeus.&amp;rsquo;
What&amp;rsquo;s up with that? In one of my fav&amp;rsquo; childhood books,
Farmer in the Sky (Robert Heinlein, 1950), Ganymede is the main
scene location.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;&lt;font size="6"&gt;Hello
Students!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to High School Math 101. In this class we will work
through math problems that I and many of my colleagues needed to
figure out on our own, armed with only a calculator and limited
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I am a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; nice teacher, and will give you for
this test, as much time as you need, and also access to any
resources you want. Let us begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often make geocaching puzzles about what they do for a
living, or what they know more about than other people. Math in all
forms is one of my favorite fortés.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I somewhat enjoy solving puzzles, but alas, like many of you
normal, small-named cachers, many times you'll take a look at
puzzles, (especially 5-star puzzles,) and have no idea what to do.
Sometimes you'll be staring in the face of a cypher, and sometimes
a wall of text that means nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="6"&gt;But not here.&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size="3.6"&gt;Here, I
shall tell you exactly what you must to do solve this
puzzle.&lt;/font&gt; (Sounds fun!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="5"&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;Right?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;Well...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 9 problems in this math test, and all of them are
iterations of problems I encountered in my high school career,
(which I&amp;rsquo;m currently in the process of finishing.) Use utmost
accuracy when solving these problems. As many decimal places as you
can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pff, High School Math? No problem. I&amp;rsquo;ll add a few
numbers, maybe even do some substitution, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be done in
a jiff!&amp;rdquo; Well generic quotable Geocacher, though I admire
your optimism, High School math could prove to be a bit harder than
you remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These problems however, are easier variants of their respective
math categories.&lt;/p&gt;
Let me repeat myself.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;These problems are EASY.&lt;/font&gt;(If you're in High
School.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ie: If a problem is Calculus, it&amp;rsquo;ll be easy,
early-in-the-year Calculus. If these problems were harder, this
puzzle might be rarely solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever watched &amp;ldquo;Are You Smarter than a 5th
Grader?&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a show where people attempt to answer
questions they (were supposed to have) learned in Elementary
School. Questions like &amp;ldquo;How many Teaspoons in a
Tablespoon?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;What is the scientific name of the Big
Dipper?&amp;rdquo; Anyway, the people on the show do so badly because
they can&amp;rsquo;t remember things they learned long ago. But people
like me, who have incredible brain capacities (I&amp;rsquo;m not
modest!) and that learned these things recently do much better.
This puzzle utilizes that idea. Times 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay on track. It&amp;rsquo;s just high school. We High Schoolers
solve and get the correct answers to all these problems at the spry
young age of 17, and that&amp;rsquo;s without resources, and in a
limited amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind while taking this infinite-time infinite-resource
test, that these are High School questions. That means all Physics
takes place in a frictionless airless vacuum, and all geometry is
Euclidean, etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="14"&gt;Begin your test!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

height of 2. If the frustum were to be extended to be a cone, that
cone would have a height of 3. What is the volume of this
frustum?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some puzzles would stop here, and let you figure out the rest of
the puzzle (the part where you figure out what to do with the
numbers, and how to turn them into coordinates) by yourself. But
because you&amp;rsquo;ve already worked so hard to come up with these 9
numbers&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="6"&gt;Not me.&lt;/font&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you
exactly what do. (But in a Geocaching related way! Yay!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With your 9 numbers in hand, just remember that this is a Puzzle
cache, not a &lt;font color="orange"&gt;MULTI&lt;/font&gt; cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take that number, and then &lt;font color="orange"&gt;LOG&lt;/font&gt; your
find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the skills to solve up to here, you should be able
to solve &lt;font color="orange"&gt;10 TIMES&lt;/font&gt; as many normal puzzle
caches!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But wait, GraffnTrix, how do I obtain the West
Coordinate? All this gives me is the North!&amp;rdquo; Fear not generic
quotable geocacher! All you need to do is subtract your North
coordinate from the following number!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="purple"&gt;&lt;font size="7"&gt;159.4986&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I am basically giving you the West coordinate, be warned,
this does not mean it will be possible for you to manipulate
Certitude. The cache is located a fair distance away, and you would
have to check, given the distance from the specified coordinates at
its maximum, 600 different numbers into the program. (Also,
Geocaching is based on the honor system, and blah blah
blah&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>[puzzle] Several of the answers to the questions have are inverses to each other, and thus equal one when multiplied. For example, the following questions could be added.

10: The probability of a coin landing on heads.
11: .25 times 8.

The product of the two answers would be 1, and therefore would not change the final answer of the coords when you multiply all the numbers together. If you can pinpoint which answers are inverses of each other, and thus are extraneous when multiplied, you can figure out which questions you don't need to answer.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">At long last, I can remove this from my list of solved but unfound puzzles.  I don't really remember the whole sequence of solving it, but from my first DNF log, I ended up in Livermore first, mostly due to my own mistake.  After getting Homer to do a jig, I've been out here three or four times for a lot of frustration.  Between the difficult hide and my own assumptions and tunnel blindness (and apparently frequently missing cache), I was never able to locate it.  And then I see that it gets replaced just a few days ago.  So I returned today with high hopes.  It still took me a long time to locate the thing - again, I was making certain assumptions, and then not using my eyes enough.  Eventually, though I spotted something a little curious, and I had the cache in hand soon after.  Thanks for the puzzle.</groundspeak:text>

This puzzle was a tough one for me.  It took me a long time to make headway and I just didn't trust my answers.  Then, MB and I worked on it together and he helped me over some of the rougher patches.  Finally, after being stuck at a very uncertain place, another geofriend offered to check the coords and found that we were only off on one question.  A little more fine tuning by MB yielded the coords and, with his help, I was able to come up with them soon after.

The cache is a tough hide but, fortunately, one I had seen from the CO before. Unfortunately, it was missing and the rest of the story is above.</groundspeak:text>

So on my way back, I must have been in an optimistic mood.  The CO had given me a little bit of a hint at one point, though I'm not sure how clearly I remember it now.  Anyways, I searched most of the places I'd tried before, to no avail.  There was one more spot I would have liked to check out more, but it was closer to the employees who seemed to be slightly interested in what I was doing.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">Good friends are always there for you.  This cache commemorates the Bay Area's TTF1K (Third To Find 1000 caches), by my good friend and caching partner, bthomas.  It took him a whole year to find his first 400 caches and only 3 more months to make the 4-digit milestone.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Since bthomas hates multi-caches, but loves drive bys - I felt it was appropriate to commemorate his achievement with a flavoring of both.  

At the posted coordinates, you will find a plaque with the same title as this cache. What you need to do is sum all of the digits you find on the plaque together.  Take the sum and divide it by two.  Then square the result.  You will find the film canister cache that many feet away from the plaque. Remember to bring a pen.  

The distance you need to cover isn't terribly far and is fully wheelchair accessible.  As far as I am aware, this is the second shortest multi in the Bay Area.

Shoemaker-Levy was a comet of Jupiter. [b]NO COMET CODE[/B]</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">THE CACHE IS NOT AT THE LISTED COORDINATES. See below for way, way advanced trajectory math.

Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 was an unusual discovery: In 1993, the Shoemakers and Levy found a train of glowing comet chunks. In the previous year, the comet’s decaying orbit brought it close enough to Jupiter (~1.5 planetary radii) that it broke up into fragments, headed for a final collision with Jupiter in 1994. 

http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/sl9/background.html

Fragments (lettered A through W), struck Jupiter from July 16 to 22. The Jupiter strikes were observed by the Galileo space probe, the Hubble Space Telescope, and Earth bound observatories. This was a unique viewing of the demise of a comet.

http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/sl9/image101.html

Epilogue: Eugene Shoemaker died in a 1997 vehicle accident. Two years later, his ashes were delivered to the Moon on the Lunar Prospector. 

ROCKET SCIENCE MATH: From the posted latitude  .040 minute decimal portion, SUBTRACT  0.0xx, where  xx equals the number of lettered fragments, A to W, with no I or O, but with replacements named P2 and Q2. 

Yes, that’s .040 - .0xx, and x and x are different digits.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A cache representing the planet Jupiter, located approximately 13.3 miles from the heart of downtown San Jose.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This is the fifth cache in a series that creates a model of the Solar System across the Bay Area and the Central Valley of California. It is the only regular cache in the series, to respect Jupiter’s rank as our Solar System’s largest planet.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/52793_300.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have placed the Sun at City Plaza Park in downtown San Jose, and have placed Mercury one mile from that location. All the other planets are placed in orbit at distances from San Jose that match the scale set with the planet Mercury. With this scale, Neptune is just a bit over 77 miles away, as the crow flies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache log sheet contains a pair of numbers - labelled &lt;i&gt;Comet Numbers&lt;/i&gt;. You should record these numbers - if you find all eight planets, your &lt;i&gt;Comet Numbers&lt;/i&gt; will help you find the bonus Halley’s Comet cache. &lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: The sum of the numbers will pinpoint an actual location, but the cache is not located there. An offset will be given on the &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?ID=54591"&gt;Halley’s Comet page&lt;/a&gt; to take you to the actual cache. (The location determined by the sum of the Comet Numbers is fun to look at with a mapping program, but again, the Halley’s Comet cache is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; there.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The container itself is a round plastic Tupperware™ container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please consider visiting the other caches in the &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/nearest.aspx?key=Northern+CA+Solar+System&amp;amp;submit4=Go"&gt;Northern California Solar System Model&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll note that there are now other types of objects listed, as well as planets. These are a wonderful extension of the series that &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=94cdbe83-fa5a-47bc-bc6c-58c54e3d73a9&amp;amp;wid=9524068e-6e61-4706-a721-429754a1cd7a&amp;amp;ds=2"&gt;bthomas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=b661c2da-8641-4a2f-ae02-ebf7b5190b11&amp;amp;wid=20b25ca3-ba57-497a-822c-10b58be42b19&amp;amp;ds=2"&gt;shadow101&lt;/a&gt; have built.&lt;/p&gt;

I put it down many times, only to come back later and remain just as stuck. Finally, I took a look at it again today and saw something on the cache page that led me to half of the coords.  The other half were still not forthcoming and I ended up making an educated guess that turned out to be right. Whew!

Even after solving, I don't know what 'fundamental word length property' means!

Thank Leelelee was along for the find today.  She zoomed right in on the hide spot while I was still wandering around grossed out by something I touched.  [B)]

If I were to make a rhyme
I would say that this time
Only one word of the hint
Will save you from time misspent

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;font color="red"&gt;The cache is not at the posted coordinates, but
is within two miles. Solve the puzzle below to determine the
coordinates.&lt;/font&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">A slightly easier one for you guys.
&lt;p&gt;At this very moment, this cache is moving at
31784.191686901375676304830060811 kilometers per sidereal day,
because of the rotation of the Earth. (Take no other movement into
effect.)&lt;/p&gt;
(The elevation is 12 feet.)
&lt;p&gt;We're going to be using geodesy, and pretend that the stationary
point the earth rotates around is where the geodetic latitude
intersects the prime meridian plane, or the "y-axis."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located a few meters away from a beautiful (in my
opinion) path that goes behind the building. Check it out while
you're there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting fun fact: I first did these calculations with a 16
digit calculator, and then a 32 digit calculator. The difference in
accuracy was one tenth of a meter. In the scale of Earth, this is
pretty small. But in the scale of incredibly accurate latitudes, it
might matter a little bit. (16 is probably enough though.)&lt;/p&gt;
Edit: I just got the answer using a graphing calculator. (An answer
that certitude likes at least.) Goes to show how inaccurate you can
actually be. Also, I graphed the earth using polar coordinates.
That was fun too.
&lt;p&gt;When you find the latitude, find the longitude by subtracting it
from the following number, in decimal form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;font color=
"purple"&gt;159.55323333333333...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But beware, the certitude solution was entered using DDD MM.MMM
format.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>[puzzle1]   WPS84
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radius#Radius_at_a_given_geodetic_latitude     
       
Use LOTS of significant figures. You're going to want to find very accurate numbers for alpha and beta. Note that you're trying to find the latitude, and that (in relation to the radius) is a single variable. A single unknown. Just plug in the numbers, and you shall see the answer.    
     
[cache] There is a chance that the cache is moving in a way that is not synchronized to the rotation of the Earth. This movement will always be in the same direction as the Earth rotates around it. (If this isn't doing it for you, think pendulum.) Between two fences.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The posted coordinates of this cache aren't too far away from my work so I've been perplexed by it since I started geocaching.   After spinning my wheels for quite some time I mentioned it to mokelly and he suggested that I practice by solving several of the other catch-22 type puzzles in the Bay Area.  I solved the list he sent me all in the same day.  For me they were trivial compared to this one.  However perseverance eventually paid off and included an ironic sense of deja-vu for me.   So despite finally understanding this one I never rushed out to make the find.  I even go right by GZ on a fairly regular basis but never had the time to stop.  Today I finally put an end to that and made this one the targeted find of the day.   Thanks for the puzzle!</groundspeak:text>

Never did get around to searching where I thought it was, and eventually a traditional cache ended up in that spot anyway; so I was completely wrong anyway. But, I'd been watching this one since it was published and when mokelly logged his find, I suddenly had a new idea. That idea ended up working, even though I didn't realize it until tonight.

My journey was much like the other solvers, I infer.  As expected, the Aha was quite satisfying, followed by a long denouement.  GZ was very pleasant on this rainy Saturday.  Thanks for another remarkable puzzle!  ...  Find #130.</groundspeak:text>

Since then, I have solved five puzzles that have been bothering me for 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 years!  For this one, I was a bit disappointed that I wasn't able to determine a solution like the first finders had.  I rather liked how the hint eventually led me to the right method.  This evening, I decided I could wait no longer to find the final.  It ended up taking me a while, mostly because I did not not take a best possible bearing into ground zero, and starting searching at some interesting, but incorrect spots.  Once I relocated and zeroed in better, it was a pretty quick find.  Thanks for another mind bender.

 &lt;br /&gt;
I helped out in my grandson’s 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; grade classroom last year…Mrs. Patterson’s class at Bubb Elementary School in Mountain View.  One day she did an exercise that helped the kids with their analytical skills, so I thought it could become a simple mystery cache.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
There were five boys and five girls in the exercise.  They were:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Girls&lt;/u&gt;                                              &lt;u&gt;Boys&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Megan                                          Eric&lt;br /&gt;
Emily                                             Kyle&lt;br /&gt;
Lyla                                               Ryan&lt;br /&gt;
Anne                                             Zachary   &lt;br /&gt;
Kimberly                                        Paul&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
The first part of the exercise was to “form a single file line, starting with a girl and alternating girl/boy/girl/boy etc., with all of the boys in alphabetical order by first name and all of the girls in alphabetical order by first name.”&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Then Mrs. Patterson stood at the front of the line and said, “Now I’m going to ask some of you to move to a new position in line, so that you will be arranged by height.”&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paul—move forward 5 places, then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kimberly—move forward 3 places, then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eric—move back 5 places, then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ryan—move back 3 places, then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Megan—move forward 3 places, then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lyla—move back 2 places, then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eric--move forward 2 places, then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zachary—move forward 2 places, then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anne and Kimberly—trade places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Mrs. Patterson then said that the first person in line would be number 0, the second person in line would be number 1, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
She then told them the geocache could be found at:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;N 37° AA.KyKiL W 122° PZ.PMP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">I lived across the street from here after moving from Los Altos
during my Junior and High School years. I remember when this park
was mostly fruit orchards. And El Camino Hospital next door.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Before moving out of Mtn. View I saw the park change. Another
memory I had growing up here is seeing the Black Squirrels. Enjoyed
watching them and the Grey Squirrels as they played in our
backyard. Now some of you are wondering "Black Squirrels?" They are
rare in some areas but here and some other areas they actually out
number the Red Squirrels.&lt;br /&gt;
What are Black Squirrels? Well they are actually a melanistic of
the Gray Squirrel, individual black squirrels can exist wherever
grey squirrels live. The black subgroup seems to have been dominant
throughout North America prior to the arrival of Europeans in the
16th century, since their dark colour helped them hide in virgin
forests which tended to be very dense and shaded. As time passed,
hunting and deforestation led to biological advantages for grey
colored individuals. Today, the black subgroup is particularly
abundant in the northern part of the Eastern Grey Squirrel's range.
This is likely due to the significantly increased cold tolerance of
black individuals which lose less heat than greys. The black
squirrels were mainly found in the UK and eastern United States.
Now they are found in Canada and in many areas across the United
States.&lt;br /&gt;
Today (10/20/11) while out caching and placing this cache, I wanted
to take a picture of a black squirrel. But sometimes they can be
very camera shy. While finding a new cache near the YMCA. I turned
around and there were 7 black squirrels and two grey ones.

Well here’s US6's first Cache ever placed.  It's a MICRO so remember to bring a Pencil or Pen with you.  You might also need a little something to help you pull the log out.  Maybe a bent paper clip. You’ll probably want to snag it and walk off to another area to make your entry and come back to replace it, especially if you come during the day.  Remember to roll up the log and put it in the lid, then screw the lid back onto the larger end.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I'm not a big fan of micro's but you should have no problem finding this one.  Just watch for the Muggles of all ages, take your time, use your Geosuaveness and you'll be able to snag this one and put it back with no one knowing...   

Ramos Park is a small park I walk though at Lunch each day and I thought I'd check to see if there was a Cache nearby. Alas there seems to be one at the other end of the park that’s not active at the moment, so I thought I’d add this one to the mix and see how long it will last.  As stated above, this will test your Geosuaveness during the day as there can be a large number of Muggles of all ages in the area.  I placed it just before 9am and there was only one person near by…

Don Jesus RAMOS Park is located at 800 East Meadow Drive in Palo Alto, CA.
It's an approximately 4.4 acre neighborhood park with an abundance of open space for a variety of recreational activities.  Typically you'll find young ones playing here a maybe a small soccer game on the field at lunch time as well.

The park has large open grassy area, children’s playground, picnic area with barbecues, benches, path around park, multi-purpose concrete slab with a basketball hoop. 

Ramos Park opened in 1958 as part of a plan to develop more recreational space south of Oregon.  It was first named Meadow Park after the tract of land that it was part of.  Now it is named after Don Jesus Ramos, a native of Mexico who came to California in search of gold.  He arrived in the Mayfield area in 1851 and in 1883  bought a couple of  acres of land and built a house at 727 Page Mill Road. Here he lived with his family until his death in 1912.</groundspeak:long_description>

As it happened, we walked in at the other end of the parking area, so this turned out to be the last cache of our Shoreline adventure, a quick grab on the way out while my lovely assistant got the car. For some reason I got it into my head that this would be super tricky, so it took me a minute to see the easy hide right in front of my nose. Thanks a lot!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">In the April 2010 Issue of The Talon, the newspaper for Los Altos High School, an article was published about Geocaching.

"What is this?" I wondered ignorantly.

It seemed interesting, and I tried it out. And failed. And tried it again. And failed. But I did gain something, I learned. And soon, I was hooked.

This cache is placed near the place where I first learned about Geocaching. The cache itself is not hard to find but opening it is a different story. It is just off school grounds, and not on their property.

Please do not use your teeth, a knife, or anything besides your hands to open the cache. You can use the top half of the cache to get the log out. It is a Micro, but there is no need to bring a writing utensil.

I wouldn't attempt this cache during, or anywhere near, the time in which school is in session, because of the massive amount of muggles and traffic.</groundspeak:long_description>

There is no need to leave the sidewalk while looking for the cache. I spent five minutes averaging the coordinates on two separate occasions so they should be pretty accurate.

05/20/2012 Cache Update: Replaced the cache for the third time today with a different type of hide at the same coordinates. I am reluctant about this third type of hide though but did my best to preserve the difficulty level. The first two cache placements were far much better but still managed to get muggled. Hopefully, this will be third time lucky! I will have to archive if it is taken again. 

I have added the "special tool" attribute to the webpage and would recommend that a future visitor bring either a tweezers, small pliers or probe with them to overcome any potential extraction problems. 

Street parking is available within 50 feet of the GZ.

Please bring our own pen and carefully re-hide the cache. 

Have fun!</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This is a cache for the displaced New Englanders in California.
Many have made the pilgrimage from the cold Northeast to sunny
California in search of new opportunities and adventures. This
cache will hopefully help New England natives bring back some good
memories of home and help everyone else learn more about those
"small and squiggly" states on the east coast.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;font color="red"&gt;**** The cache is not at the given coordinates.
"X" does NOT mark the spot! Keep reading... ****&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache container has been replaced with a "baby soda bottle"
due to multiple muggling and a nearby homeless resident, so trading
opportunities are limited. If you're from New England, please also
log your state. &lt;b&gt;Please use the attachment wire to keep squirrels
and the earth's gravity from misplacing this cache..&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For automobiles, between 9 am and 6 pm when the Red Sox are in
season, you'll need the toll from West Stockbridge to Newton on the
Mass Pike plus 40 cents to access the cache. The rest of the year
and at off-hours is free...or park to the west, near the dump
(GC1AY8M), and bicycle or walk about a mile on Caribbean Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True Story: I went to AAA to get some maps for this cache and
some other trips. I asked the woman behind the counter for New
England maps. She asked which states, and I just asked for all the
New England states. She came back with maps of New Hampshire,
Vermont, Maine... and Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania. This was
at a &lt;b&gt;travel agency&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, you'll need to know a bit about New England
before you can find this cache. For native New Englanders, this
should be wicked easy. For the rest of you, add a star to the
difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located at North 37'AB.CDE West 121'FG.HIJ. Answer
the following questions correctly to discover A-J.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. Which is the smallest New England state by area?&lt;br /&gt;
2: Rhode Island&lt;br /&gt;
3: Delaware&lt;br /&gt;
4: New Hampshire&lt;br /&gt;

B. Which state is home to Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream?&lt;br /&gt;
3: New Hampshire&lt;br /&gt;
4: Vermont&lt;br /&gt;
5: Maine&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
C. The Isles of Shoals are part of which state(s)?&lt;br /&gt;
7: New Hampshire&lt;br /&gt;
8: Maine and New Hampshire&lt;br /&gt;
9: Maine&lt;br /&gt;
0: Massachusetts&lt;br /&gt;
1: Massachusetts and New Hampshire&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
D. Mount Washington is the highest peak of which state?&lt;br /&gt;
5: Massachusetts&lt;br /&gt;
6: New Jersey&lt;br /&gt;
7: New Hampshire&lt;br /&gt;
8: Maine&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
E. Which city is home to Harvard University?&lt;br /&gt;
6: Harvard, Mass.&lt;br /&gt;

Please hide it as well as you hopefully found it - with the lid face-down, and surrounded by some natural cover.

Echidnaboy (12) chose the location, and I had him run back and forth to take multiple coordinate readings, hence his idea for the cache title. The tree cover might also contribute to slightly wild coordinate readings... if anyone has any updates to suggest, do feel free.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I've long had a fascination with the sea and sailing. If I weren't so susceptible to seasickness I believe I would have enjoyed a sailing trip around the world in my younger days. I've also enjoyed many books about seafaring men. Below are some quotes from books I've read. Solve the puzzle and check your answer in certitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left:2em;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;...lips are curved upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face, this whale.&lt;br /&gt;
Santa Barbara has gained but little. I should not know, from anything I saw, that she was now a seaport of the United States.&lt;br /&gt;
Nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless.&lt;br /&gt;
...windward and kept the tiller up till a new rope could be rove. On the morning of the twentieth at...&lt;br /&gt;
...previous to descending upon the line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere else foiled...&lt;br /&gt;
...the voyage, and the hard and exposed life, we were in the remote parts of the earth, on an almost ...&lt;br /&gt;
...man said, "I have enough line to handle him." Maybe if I can increase the tension just a little...&lt;br /&gt;
...old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was...&lt;br /&gt;
...on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been anywhere...&lt;br /&gt;
...were living on the beach, keeping up a grand carnival. There was a large oven on the beach, which, it seems...&lt;br /&gt;
"...you borrow. Then you beg." "Keep warm old man," the boy said. Remember we are in September."&lt;br /&gt;
...harbor in the dark. There were other boats from the other beaches going...&lt;br /&gt;
They picked up the gear from the boat. The old man carried the mast.&lt;br /&gt;
this is the magic glass, man! I see my wife and my child in thine eye.&lt;br /&gt;
The harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him, aye.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Very interestingly, I came up with an idea I thought at the time was very clever to reduce the amount of effort needed to solve this one.  And it worked fantastically - I was able to clean up the last little bit very quickly.  It was only a bit later that I realized that there was a flaw in my reasoning.  At least I think there is - but it sure seemed to work well anyways.  I stopped by to pick up the cache on my way home from work this evening.  No problems finding it.

Well, even with the hint, nothing I tried worked too well (hey, do I have to try all 67+ million combinations? [:p]), until a smart geofriend of mine took a pity and gave me a few letters. Even with the few letters, actually, there were so many unknowns I had to try. So I semi-automated one of the most tedious parts with a tool to get things moving, and that really helped.

I almost left it in one position, and then reached back to adjust it a little bit.  That's when I got jabbed in the head - and I had even made a point of being careful about that one the first couple of times.  The tiny cut on my finger was insignificant compared to that.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Are you into collecting coins and bills from faraway places? Have
coins and bills left over from past trips? Here's your chance to
trade them. Fair trade only please!
&lt;p&gt;Cache is located on private property by permission of the
owners, but can be accessed from the sidewalk. No need to enter the
yard! At certain times of the day and year this location is
swarming with mugglettes and guarded by a crossing guard.
It&amp;rsquo;s accessible 24 hours and reasonably well lit, so you may
want to come by after hours or when the view is partially
obstructed by a parked car. Bigger than a small but smaller than a
regular. Don't be afraid to look under the leaves!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-to-find gets 500 Rupees!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18-Aug-11 update: Yea, IME is back on line! After two years
archived the cache had been restocked for it's second incarnation.
We put a selection of coins from Fiji inside, if you'd like to take
a look. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;This is a cool micro-wilderness area in the middle of the city.&lt;/b&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There was an ammo box there, but it was vandalized and stolen. A neighbor posted a note and a small bag that served as the cache for a bit and then some kind soul found another ammo box, so everything is almost as it was before. This is a very popular cache, as can be seen by all the cool things Geocachers drop by. Check it out today!
&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is the cache page as of 08/22/2003 (My find #22, eight years exactly from when I found it to the date I adopted it!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little cache history: Beckerbuns was that kind soul who replaced the ammo box on 05/25/2003. She then adopted it on 02/17/2004 from &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/3avdycn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt; and Joseph Ruff. The cache was replaced on or about 06/12/2007 by southbayday (subsequent name change to WWC - World's Worst Cacher) and in late January 2009, again by WWC. (Double thanks!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of &lt;b&gt;12/03/2011&lt;/b&gt;, the cache once again is an ammo box, with very 'heavy' camo. Please bring gloves, you will be glad. This is still a very busy area so be stealthy to the degree you can. Please take an extra minute to ensure the cache is well hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original cache owner info: 'A' is &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/3rgxjm6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Andrew Naylor&lt;/a&gt;, the original owner. &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/434sj4v" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Joseph Ruff&lt;/a&gt; is the owner of another very old local cache &lt;a href="http://coord.info/GC148" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;GC148, The Dump.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to this cache being regularly muggled by (I presume) kids, I have reluctantly made it a Premium Member Only cache to see if that helps. The D/T rating is probably higher than what is listed, but after all these years it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
On January 17, 2012, the Mountain View City Council approved, over strong and repeated public objections, a plan for the Cuesta Annex flood basin. That means in the near future this cache site *may* no longer exist, being part of that plan area. It is still under discussion the exact final plan. So get this one while you can.

There were lots of dog walkers in the area, inlcuding one who went through a gate presumably into a backyard very close to us.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of sixteen caches in the Light Rail Cache
Series that you'll need to find in order to find the &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?ID=65323"&gt;seventeenth&lt;/a&gt;
cache.&lt;/p&gt;

A photo-realistic rendering of a light rail station next to the
Moffett Park development. &amp;nbsp; A train sits at the modern, glass
and steel station while another pulls in and people move about the
platform. &amp;nbsp; The shining, glass fronted buildings of Moffett
Park in Sunnyvale stand in the background. &amp;nbsp; Trees and
landscaping frame the scene, while a few cars are visible parked in
the foreground.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
Take a ride on the light rail. &amp;nbsp; These caches have been
designed to get you out of your auto and spend some time on public
transportation, but you do not need to ride on the light rail to
find them. &amp;nbsp; Each of the sixteen caches has been placed near
stations along the &lt;a href=
"http://www.vta.org/schedules/lr_interactive_map/lrBusMap.html"&gt;Santa
Clara Valley Light Rail&lt;/a&gt; line. &amp;nbsp; Each cache can be logged
on its own, but you'll need to find the first sixteen caches in
order to obtain the coordinates for the seventeenth cache. &amp;nbsp;
The log for each cache, except one, includes a numerical value or
code word that is used to figure out the final coordinates for the
seventeenth cache.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;font color="red"&gt;Cache not coordinates... blah blah blah... you
know how it goes.&lt;/font&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">There are so many puzzles out there where you have to figure out
what to do, and then do it. There's so much room to be wrong, and
not enough room for creativity.
&lt;p&gt;This puzzle is different. I'm going to tell you exactly what I
did, and all you can come up with your own creative way to reverse
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the coordinates an image, and split it up into separate
frames of 25x25 pixels, which makes up an animated gif. Here's an
example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/1ZELa.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 18 squares of 25x25 pixels. The squares are read left
to right, and then left to right on the next line. Each of these is
a frame. See if you can see how the image relates to the below
animated gif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/2peL9.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here's the same encoding method, but encoding a picture with
the number 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/pXa89.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/jeVJX.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the 3 is made out of 25x25 squares of pixels,
which just like in the last few examples, are read in order as a
gif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the puzzle. I will give you the animated gif, and you
just need to construct the original picture that created it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final image should be 775 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall,
or 775x300. That's 31 columns and 12 rows of 25x25 pixel
squares.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">0928h - I've always been a bit uneasy with this CO's puzzles and this one required a tool I didn't have ready access to.  So I put it aside until Bamsch recently mentioned something about it.  He had the solution but couldn't remember all the details regarding how the digits were actually hidden.   I went back and resurrected notes for the puzzle and played around with a few items I had downloaded.   After a little more work I had a viable path to the same coordinate set that Bamsch had provided.   After comparing notes it seems I did it the hard way.  Oh well, it's not the first time and it won't be the last.  Thanks for a good one.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Space Ship was low on fuel, and the crew couldn't care less.
Alice was busy getting the Final Transmission achievement in Portal
2. Bob was busy working on &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC22GEQ"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;
puzzle cache. The captain scolded the crew for their
insubordination, and realized he had only one choice; he was going
to have to make an emergency landing.
&lt;p&gt;But alas, the captain did not know where he was. He decided to
take a risky option, to use the remainder of his fuel to see if
there were any lifeforms around who could help him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After eight minutes, the captain stumbled upon another ship, the
Robot-36. The aliens on board noticed the captain needed help, and
sent &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/7pzzzj3"&gt;a transmission.&lt;/a&gt; Just
before the Space ship ran out of fuel, the transmission came in on
the ship's ham radio, and the Space Ship set a course for a nearby
blue planet to land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They arrived at the planet going at Terminal Velocity, and
landed at the end of a secret passage full of plants and water,
just narrowly missing a radio tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They left a container full of little trinkets to commemorate
where they landed. And forever onwards, the crew had a vision of a
sunset in their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
Cache is under wood, note the 2.5 terrain.

I still remember the "interesting" conversations I had with RolloTreadway about this puzzle when it first came out. He assured me that I would be able to solve it. But then the link was broken, so maybe not. But then the link was fixed, so maybe. And with a bit of final encouragement from TgrrLili, I realized an assumption I'd made about my technological limitations was incorrect. I was surprised to discover the accessibility of what I needed, and I soon had a lovely set of coords in hand.

Overall, really fascinating topics that had been completely unfamiliar to me before. Made the rather sketchy find experience (I don't think I would have ventured there without my geofriend) worthwhile!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;Step 2. Multiply together the number of N's, C's and U's in the
completed puzzle grid, that is, n*c*u where n= the number of N's,
etc. That is a 4-digit number representing the last four digits of
the North coordinates, i.e the X's in N37 2X.XXX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3. Next total each S, E, A, and H as one group, then do the
same for R and L. Multiply those two totals, i.e. (s+e+a+h)*(r+l).
That result is a 4-digit number representing the last four digits

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I had a hard time with this crossword since a number of answers are more than one word [:I]. I think it helped that I solved three other crossword puzzles by this CO in the last week. There was one word that could be spelled with an “E” or an “I” so this caused some consternation when the congratulations message didn’t pop up after I filled in the last letter. I told Mrs. TNS one of my answers and she replied “What? It should be...”, and she was right [:D]. I didn’t know why the funny image was on the top of the crossword page until I was about halfway finished with the puzzle. When I finally figured it out, it made me smile [:)]. Since I couldn’t ignore the crooked fence post cap, I found the cache the second place that I checked. This was the seventh day in a row that I found a cache by this CO (and like God, I think it’s time for a rest) [:P]. TNLNSL TFTC #1068</groundspeak:text>

coordinates.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The coordinates above are the starting point of a virtual journey.
&amp;nbsp; The journey includes two parts and the cache will be found
at the end of the second part.&amp;nbsp; For the first part of the
journey, you'll travel north for the first leg, then south for the
second leg, then north, and so on.&amp;nbsp; The ratio of the distance
traveled on a given leg to the distance traveled on the previous
leg is defined as q.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
q = D&lt;small&gt;(2)&lt;/small&gt;/D&lt;small&gt;(1)&lt;/small&gt; =
D&lt;small&gt;(3)&lt;/small&gt;/D&lt;small&gt;(2)&lt;/small&gt; =
D&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(4)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;/D&lt;small&gt;(3)&lt;/small&gt; =
D&lt;small&gt;(n)&lt;/small&gt;/D&lt;small&gt;(n-1)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first part of the journey ends when the distance being traveled
becomes immeasurably small.&amp;nbsp; The point at which the first part
ends will become the starting point of the second part.&amp;nbsp; For
the second part of the journey, you'll travel east for the first
leg, then west for the second leg, then east, and so forth.&amp;nbsp;
Just as in the first part, the distance traveled on a given leg to
the distance traveled on the previous leg is the same ratio
q.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ratio of the total distance traveled during the second part of
the journey to the total distance traveled during the first part is
also equal to q.&amp;nbsp; The total distance traveled for both parts
of the journey will be the product of 10,000 meters and the
reciprocal of q.&amp;nbsp; The ratio q is a special irrational number
because it&amp;rsquo;s reciprocal is equal to itself plus one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1/q = q + 1&lt;br /&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I'm proud of solving this puzzle since it was a bit harder than the only other unknown cache I completed to date, and it taught me more about some of the tools available to find a location given distance and direction.  The math part of the puzzle was not too difficult (after reading the description more carefully), but getting the final coordinates figured correctly required a bit more work for me.

On my way to the cache in this morning my GPSr batteries died, but I remembered where it was thanks to using Google Earth in my solution cross-check. The container was an easy find, but unfortunately water had completely soaked the contents! Since it has been 9 months from the last find, I took it and dried it out completely before bagging the log, which is legible but tattered. Replaced the container with the lid facing UP.  Sideways (as found) will cause moisture to wick in again.  Thanks to cachbefound for a fun puzzle, I'll have to try a few more of these.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The reason that UTM doesn't work for this is that UTM northing is not actually due north.  It varies with the longitude; the further you are from the central UTM line, the further northing is from true north.The UTM northing is called "grid north," for what it's worth.  It also depends on the latitude, of course, because at the Equator grid north is always true north.   I think that in the Bay Area it's about 1.5 degrees different, which makes a big difference on puzzles like this one!

The puzzle was right up my alley, so no big deal.  I stopped by today and the area was deserted, so I just parked right next to it.  Nice container!</groundspeak:text>

I had to refresh on infinite series, but then the math was quite elegant.  Finding the location though was much less elegant for me and took a series of Homer's d'oh's before I taught myself enough about coordinate systems to be get a success.  At least now I have a calculator.  Nice hide too.  Thanks for the fun cache!  sl  tnln.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;Over the years there has been some concern about the wasps that
sometimes are present. It was best said by an early finder: "Those
wasps are paper wasps. Unlike hornets or yellowjackets they leave
people alone and don't get aggressive or defensive. They may sting
if their nests are damaged, but if you leave the nest alone you
have nothing to fear. They do kill and eat pests such as flys and
destructive beetles and caterpillars so consider these little wasps
the good guys!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I had a tough time with the &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=a3dd3925-32ae-4ab2-9063-b62919d412b7&amp;amp;wid=f3594339-f033-48c8-9c75-1fcd4d34204a&amp;amp;ds=2"&gt;Kablooey&lt;/a&gt; puzzle challenge this year. To exorcize that experience I've decided to make a "blame it on Kablooey" puzzle. One of the 12 puzzles that threw me for a loop was &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=gc35451"&gt;413 Digits&lt;/a&gt;. I analyzed the title then had an idea based upon past Kablooey experience and went about it. Of course it was wrong, but as it so often happens I got stuck in that rut and just couldn't get out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I did eventually solve it. I realized that in order to take a byte out of a Kablooey puzzle you need to index all your puzzle solving techniques and re-assemble a select few into a puzzle assault (well, that's not exactly how it went down, but let's say it did &lt;img src="http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_wink.gif" border="0" align="middle" /&gt; You can ask mokelly for the real truth). Do the same here and you should succeed also (you too can ask mokelly). If all else fails you can just&lt;!--sounds like--&gt; ask me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my two previous revisions of 413 digits has left the puzzle caching community at large scratching their heads and to make it more dissimilar from Kablooey's original I've decided to give you 512 digits instead.&lt;br /&gt;

That's a problem with hardware -- essentially infinite flexibility, it doesn't channel you into a mode of thinking like a particular computer instruction set will.  I eventually got puzzle fatigue and gave up, in spite of getting a few helpful hints from the owner.  Yesterday, I took another look at it, realized I had missed a particular permutation of the possibilities, and it just happened to be the right one.  I stopped by today on my mini-puzzle run cleaning out a few of the local puzzles that I finally solved.  TFTP</groundspeak:text>

The latest update finally steered me in the right direction - the tital change brought my attention back to the puzzle, and the hint got rid of that bad idea.  After that, it was a quick solve.

I found the puzzle to be pretty tough. Even after gleaning the correct interpretation of the clues, I still couldn't make it work. I don't believe that there are enough people who think like mcdurr to really call this a 3.5 star puzzle [;)]. As I was teasing him, I think he was fretting way to much about the lack of solvers. It was hard to imagine that the FTF was still available, but it was, so I decided to rectify that. Had to wait out some folks getting ready for work (I'm assuming), but it was a quick find after that. Thanks for the hair-puller.</groundspeak:text>

After quite some time staring at this one, I had found some coordinates, but I didn't believe that they were correct.  After reading some other logs last night, I convinced myself that I did actually have the right answer.  So I stopped by this evening, and looked around for a while.  That didn't work, and it seems that my initial feeling about those coordinates was right, even I had the wrong reason.  Now, after spending a little more time, I have the right answer, and finally understand what others have been talking about in their logs.  Now I just need to make it back over there to find it.</groundspeak:text>

There used to be a cache in this park called "B afraid (again)"

When looking for this cache, you do need to be afraid, be scared, and have fear. Only when you find this cache, will you need to face those demons.

This cache is large, but I almost made it a micro. When you find it you'll know why. This cache was an idea I had a while back, and I felt it was right to make it an homage to a cache that once was, and almost in the exact same location. There is no room for trade items. When I hide caches, I think "What would people have fun finding?"

Enjoy. Replace as found with lots of cover.</groundspeak:long_description>

Edit: turns out I only found the "red herring" hide; it had a log that I signed, but evidently this wasn't the cache. I wasn't expecting that because I hadn't read logs. Changed to a DNF.

&lt;p&gt;I went out for my usual morning run today but when I turned on
my mp3 player the top song on my playlist was not what I expected.
The song sounded all scrambled up and out of order. Thinking it
might be a glitch I went on to the next song in the playlist but it
was all scrambled up too. My entire playlist had been sabotaged!
Who could have such Audacity!? I can't set new personal best times
on sports drinks alone. I need my playlist repaired! I'll hire only
those who are qualified. If you can repair my &lt;a href=
"http://www.youdzone.com/geocaching/GC2WA7G.mp3"&gt;song&lt;/a&gt; I'll
reward you with the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the enciphered location of the contract. It is
encrypted with an RC4 stream cipher. To decrypt it use
candcfamily's decoder. Just copy and paste the cipher text into his
decoder &lt;a href="http://candcfamily.comxa.com/ciphers/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
Click on the RC4 link, select 'Decrypt' form the drop down menu and
paste the cipher text into the box. Then enter the song title in
all CAPS with no whitespace characters into "The Key" box. If you
get gibberish you have the wrong song title or you made a typo.&lt;/p&gt;

I finally got over that one and got to real work on this one.  A relatively quick solve, given that I had been somewhat involved in  the related activities before, and the musical part is relatively fun for me.  Darn - I just checked, and the first names don't match up - I was really hoping that they would.  Stopped by to pick up the cache on my way home from work.

I really enjoyed working through this puzzle.  I always enjoy the ways Venona encourages me to add capabilities to my solving tools, and it's fun to have occasion to use the tools again.  And I liked that this wasn't an exact replication of a Venona puzzle but added a fun new element.

I was hoping to make this puzzle milestone #800, but didn't DNF anything before this one today.  In the midst of a plethora of moon logic and mind reading puzzles these days, this stands out as a real gem.  Thanks for another fun one.</groundspeak:text>

This activity was the only one I had an insight on, and followed closely, so I knew what I needed to do. However, while I did the first step quickly, I wasn't sure about the second step to take. I wanted to solve it a different way, a way that I presumed was more logical, but the actual method turned out to be slightly different in a very important way. Fortunately I bounced my idea off TNS who quickly set me straight so no heading down any blind alley. In return, I told him about a new function of an old tool [:)]

Came by today and found the cache after a little bit of searching. A little tricky, but not too bad (if I can find it, it can't be too bad [:)]), nice hide. Thanks for a fun one, and for a chance to practice what I learned in the very informative Activities.</groundspeak:text>

The true goal of this geoocache is to bring you to the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge (see more info at: www.fws.gov/desfbay/). However, while you're there, why not have some caching fun?

Since you're not allowed to hide a cache inside the refuge, I set-up this 2-stage multicache. The first stage is at the posted coordinates in the refuge. There you will see two metal signs, one is red and the other is blue. You'll find a small 6-digit code printed at the upper-left corner of these signs:

Red: 37-ABCD
Blue:  37-EFGH

Use these codes to find the final, which is located less than a mile a way, just outside the refuge:

N 37 XB.CXG  
W 122 H.FCG

The cache is a tethered small camoed bottle. Please be careful when removing it. There's room for small items only. I left a few Israeli coins for the first finders.

IMPORTANT: Reaching the stages of this cache requires considerable care, and should not be attempted by young children, people with vertigo, or during an earthquake. Please use common sense!
Oh ya, and don't forget to stop, and look around you at this beautiful wildlife refuge. Enjoy.

Additional Waypoints
</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>First: You may need to bring your glasses

by the coffee house and get a tall cappuccino (my personal

couple officers' vehicles or fire trucks parked there on a coffee
break. This may even make your caching experience more exciting!

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;We have been waiting for the local bike trail to go by our house
for over a decade. Most important to us is a bike bridge over 85.
While the Caped Cavy Crusader can fly over the freeway in her magic
cape, we mere sidekicks must ride over El Camino Real and risk life
and limb, not to mention no small amount of inconvenience to get to
the established Mountain View bike path (Come on Sunnyvale, pick up
the pace!). Thus have we been pining for this bike bridge. But no
longer! At the time the cache was placed the sound wall had been
opened up and cement piers poured. According to my chat with one of
the workers, the path is scheduled to open late fall, though other
estimates put it in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that ship has sailed! So it will definitely push into next
year (as TeamOttlot noted). Hubby says he's seen estimates of April
on Mr Roadshow. As long as it is in time for nice weather, I'm
good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a nice bright green buffalo tube, but it is
camouflaged in a second container. Be sure to put it back as you
found it. There is ABSOLUTLEY no need to look within the confines
of shrubs. This cache is not in a bush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on and hurry up, bike bridge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring your own pencil or pen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a long overdue congrats to the FTF. Yay! Wildbun! I have a
soft spot for little furry things like guinea pigs and bunnies...I
guess that's obvious from out caching name!&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Pass from the walk
Interfere with no shrubbery
Now don’t balk
Easy to near discovery
Consider the title words.
Owls squirrels and birds
Not earthworm or dog
Espy this cache and its log.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">My wife volunteers in the auxiliary at El Camino Hospital. Once
when I was there to pick her up the floors were being waxed by one
of the custodians. He had put up a hand-written sign warning people
of the slippery conditions. I noticed something unusual about the
wording on the sign. I realized that his warning message could be
encrypted using a very simple if rather impractical cipher system.
The system wouldn't work for many messages, but for this one it was
perfect. Below is the message on the sign encrypted with this
system:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;font size="4" face="Lucida Console"&gt;XKDAL IBJSK OMCPL IKELC NGWTB
OWSKI CSKOC WANQE BULTA DIOKS WCIYK LJOSB CLFLD WENIA XOWKT CSCAM
MIBUI ORNJD WDTCK IDTSP DJELB NCWXU ISSCO ANIXC NXTSA ILCDO WIBZX
LINTC DTSEA LCSIL XJXDO WAISS CIKYA HXLWK ASLKW SNISU AEXMK WLSLW
XKXJB CXPAS LKNVD EWSAL LDKUO T&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For those of you who know that I often use ciphers from the
American Cryptogram Association, this sytem is not one of theirs,
nor, so far as I am aware, has it ever been used by anyone before.
Yet basic analysis should break this message easily. The message is
shorter than the ciphertext above. The final three-word sentence of
the message seemed a bit quirky to me for such a warning sign, but
when I thought about it, it was logical and good advice considering
the condition of the floors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To obtain the coordinates of the cache, you must decrypt the
message then perform the calculations below. For these formulas the
capital letters each represent the position where that letter first
appears in the decrypted message. For example, if the decrypted
message were the title of this cache, Slippery When Wet, then W
would equal 9 since the W first appears as the 9th letter of the
message. Don't count spaces. Similarly P would be 4 and T would be
15. There would be no letter representing 5 because the P in that
position is not the first place the P appears. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The coordinates are in the form&lt;br /&gt;
 N37 22.nnn&lt;br /&gt;
 W122 04.www.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
nnn = (X times T) + (O times B) + I&lt;br /&gt;
 www= (N times Y times L) + (E times P) + (M times J) + B&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Then, while returning it, I dropped it and it rolled into a rather hard to reach location [:o] Went back to my car, and found a tool which I used to retrieve it. While retrieving it, a lady saw me and asked what I was doing. Told her I dropped something, and showed her the cache without explaining what it was. Walked back to the car, and after she left, I returned the cache to its original location.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Bummer. I was surprised I actually managed to decode the message - cryptography is not my strength, and I can barely break a cipher when I know the method. However, the first thing I tried actually yielded the message. But I couldn't quite make out the hint - I got a few variations and none of them made sense. Searching in an extended area did not yield anything, though I must admit I'm a bit nervous about being seen so didn't try real hard. Will have to come back another time.

program to find the real coordinates.&lt;/font&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;My friend Mentat and I had a hack war a while ago to see who
could hack a certain program to get the most points. I used a
macro, he used a Window Manager. He won. I did however decide that
it would make a good Geocaching puzzle, and started
programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, everyone loves points. It's why high score
tables exist, it's why the users on servers log in later to get
later pseudo-terminals. When shown &lt;a href=
"http://www.thepointsgame.zxq.net"&gt;The Points Game,&lt;/a&gt; people
always click it for a long while to see how many points they can
get. Not a one ever just says "Oh that's nice," and continues on
his/her merry way. This puzzle sees just how far you may be willing
to go to get points, and just how many points you'll be able to
get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the next several days harnessing the power of human
desire to get points by writing a little friend and moderator. His
name is &lt;a href=
"http://www.thepointsgame.zxq.net/index.php"&gt;index.php.&lt;/a&gt; He's
there to help you make sure you get as many points as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try your hand at The Points Game &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=
"http://www.thepointsgame.zxq.net"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Due to the structure of server-side PHP, there is some lag
between the clicks and the messages. This is because with each
click where there is a message, the program must run through the
entire "else if" chain. Allow time for each message to load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Love love love the movie in question, but when I was first looking at the cache, I could not see the background page to help clue me in to that theme.  I'm pretty sure I solved this the "hard" way by slowly brute forcing the solution using online tools.
It was fun, and a good learning experience, but I think I made a lot more work for myself than I needed to. [B)]

It was a beautiful day today &amp; seemed like a good time to see if we could finally locate Farmboy. RT fetched me the cache from it's hiding spot &amp; when I asked him to return it he asked what would I do without him. Good thing we mostly cache together. ;) TFTP! #706</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br /&gt;
NO need to go down any slope or passed any fence for this
cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Replaced in a new location not far from the original hiding spot.
Placed toward the back of Terman Park. This is the second in a
series of caches placed around the city of Los Altos. You can
approach this cache from two directions. The most scenic is from
the Los Altos side. Parking is available along Los Altos Ave. You
can then take the paved trail straight to the cache. The second is
from Terman Park. You might have to dodge a few soccer players, but
the walk is shorter. The 2 rating is mainly for the high volume of
people using the trail.&lt;br /&gt;

      "red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The magnetic micro cache is not at posted
      coordinates, but it is within 2 miles.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; Solve the
      puzzle to determine the real coordinates. Bring your own pen!
      And now, the puzzle:</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;font color="blue"&gt;One of my current projects is remodeling
      the bathrooms in my home. Right now, I'm removing old ceramic
      tiles. Generally, these home projects give me puzzle ideas.
      As the old tiles came off, the puzzle idea emerged. Many of
      the tiles in the diagram below are still in place, kind of
      like my shower wall looked at one point. I've given you a
      clue or two, or seven, or perhaps even twelve, to help you
      reveal the coordinates in the diagram.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;i&gt;notes:&lt;br&gt;
 - no programming or math skills required&lt;br&gt;
 - real coordinates digit checksum = 35&lt;br&gt;
 - I can't seem to set difficulties very well, so please submit
your opinion.&lt;br&gt;
- 5/17/04: Downgrading difficulty from 4 to 3 stars based on recent
feedback. (Seems that folks are solving the puzzle without finding
the main hint(s), as I suspected.)&lt;br&gt;
- 6/8/04: Changed the tile colors to help in printing the page on
black &amp;amp; white printers.&lt;br&gt;
 - 12/03/04: Added a puzzle hint.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;br&gt;

After reading the hint, I had some idea what I might be looking for.  Arrived at GZ and it was in the first place I looked.  However, I didn't find it on the first search and spent some time, in the drizzly rain and dark, checking all of the wrong places. Got back in the car, read a few logs and debated phoning a friend.  Decided to check the first place one more time and this time, to my relief, I found it.  The rain started to pour down just after that.

&lt;br /&gt;
Got to find the clue in this photo to find the cache. &lt;br /&gt;
Eyes may not be enough. &lt;br /&gt;
Technology skills will be required. &lt;br /&gt;
A keen mind may be better than a keen eye with this photo. &lt;br /&gt;
Photos can contain more than just images when obvserved properly.
&lt;br /&gt;
Realize this and you'll solve the puzzle more easily! &lt;br /&gt;
Once you learn the trick in this puzzle, you'll think of photos in
a new way. &lt;br /&gt;
Gifs are one popular format for digital images. &lt;br /&gt;
Realize however, that this photo is not a gif. &lt;br /&gt;
Another photo format is tiff. &lt;br /&gt;
Many digital photos are made in the bmp format. &lt;br /&gt;
Now and then you'll even see one in png format. &lt;br /&gt;
Although these formats exist, you need not be too concerned with
them. &lt;br /&gt;
Many digital photos these days are another format. &lt;br /&gt;
Eyeball this jpg formatted photo, for instance. &lt;br /&gt;
Download it so you can really see what I am trying to help you see.
&lt;br /&gt;
Jpg happens to be one of my favorite digital photo formats. &lt;br /&gt;
Please, don't modify it or you'll destroy the clues! &lt;br /&gt;
Hidden in the photo is the cache location. &lt;br /&gt;
"In the photo" may take on a new meaning for you. &lt;br /&gt;
Don't believe everything you see. &lt;br /&gt;
Every so often, what you cannot see is more important. &lt;br /&gt;
Exactly what is in the photo? &lt;br /&gt;
X may mark the spot, or maybe not. &lt;br /&gt;
Trees, trucks, cars, pavement, poles, tools, pixels - any of these
may hold the clue you need. &lt;br /&gt;
Realize that there may be more than meets the eye. &lt;br /&gt;
Anyone can solve this one if they just try. &lt;br /&gt;
Come on now, don't give up! &lt;br /&gt;
The solution is in the photo! &lt;br /&gt;
The photo holds the key. &lt;br /&gt;
Hidden in the photo is the answer, but you must read this very
carefully first. &lt;br /&gt;
Evaluate the photo to find what you seek. &lt;br /&gt;
Solve the puzzle. &lt;br /&gt;
Once you do it you can find the cache. &lt;br /&gt;
Look carefully for the clue. &lt;br /&gt;
Under or over? &lt;br /&gt;
Top or bottom? &lt;br /&gt;
Inside or outside? &lt;br /&gt;
On or in? &lt;br /&gt;
North or south? &lt;br /&gt;
Front or back? &lt;br /&gt;
Rear or front? &lt;br /&gt;
One or two or three or...? &lt;br /&gt;
Mind over matter perhaps? &lt;br /&gt;
The cache contains a logsheet and standard Geocache notes only.
&lt;br /&gt;
Haven't found it yet? &lt;br /&gt;
Enough searching and you'll discover it. &lt;br /&gt;
Photo holds the answer. &lt;br /&gt;
Have to look for it there. &lt;br /&gt;
Overlooking something? &lt;br /&gt;
Try another angle perhaps. &lt;br /&gt;
Once you see it you'll get it, or vice versa. &lt;br /&gt;
Use your brain. &lt;br /&gt;
See with your mind and your eyes. &lt;br /&gt;
Ignore most of what I have written if you wish, you probably see
the answer by now anyway. &lt;br /&gt;
Now you should be seeing the solution develop. &lt;br /&gt;
Geocaching has helped you develop sophisticated searching skills,
use them! &lt;br /&gt;
Please bring a writing instrument along to sign the log sheet.
&lt;br /&gt;
A thorough look into these clues and the photo is all it takes.
&lt;br /&gt;
So are you getting the message? &lt;br /&gt;
Seeing more clearly now? &lt;br /&gt;
With the right approach you can do it. &lt;br /&gt;
Once you get it you might laugh! &lt;br /&gt;
Real close now. &lt;br /&gt;
Don't give up. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 3/15/05: Added a hint, which if used reduces difficulty by half a
star. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 4/11/05: Added another hint. Beginning on this date, virtual logs
from solvers &amp;gt; 25 miles away from the posted coordinates WERE
accepted, but... &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 11/7/05: &lt;b&gt;Virtual logs will no longer be accepted. This is due
to edict issued by Groundspeak representative. (See my note logged
on this date for details.)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
08/12/08: Replaced &amp;amp; re-placed the cache. Re-solve the puzzle
if you solved it before this date.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I’ve lost count of the number of times that I have looked at his puzzle since I started geocaching almost 4 years ago. I’m reminded of the fact that I hadn’t solved it each time that I visit the shopping center or get my car washed across the street. I’m not sure what finally made me see the solution [:O]. The embarrassing [:I] part is that I’ve tried the solution before on this puzzle and other puzzles [B)]. This was my oldest unsolved CO puzzle and probably the oldest puzzle that I have put significant effort into solving [:P]. I’m glad that I resisted the temptation to decrypt the hint. This made the solution and find all the more rewarding [^]. 

I’m not sure if the cache has migrated [?] but I grabbed a snail [:O] the first place that I checked and the cache [:D] the second place I checked. I re-hid the cache where I found it but not the snail [:)]. Thanks WeBeDnD and Motorbug for keeping this one alive for almost 9 years [^]. TNLNSL TFTC #1237</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">We're running out of trails on which to place caches, and this one
barely qualifies. It really is only half a trail, so I really
couldn't see hiding a full size cache. 
&lt;p&gt;The cache isn't quite fully camo'd, and contains less than a
logbook and pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you have half as much fun finding it as I did placing
it!&lt;/p&gt;

The area I'm in has frequent "walkers", especially during the noon hour.  When you are at the cache you are pretty hidden but still use a bit of stealth.  No need to do any bushwacking.  I'm surrounded  with puzzle caches so I'm  just an easy  one to find pretty quickly. It's a little tricky when found. Congratulations to MotorBug FTF

When I got back, he was still there, so I went for a longer walk around another block.  As I was coming back I saw the man standing outside the SUV, and as I got closer, he got in the SUV and drove away.  Except now there was a man in the parking lot next to GZ talking on his phone.  I took a chance he was too wrapped up in his conversation to notice me, and swooped in for the clever hide.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;THE CACHE IS NOT AT THE POSTED COORDINATES. HOWEVER, IT IS WITHIN 1 MILE. COMPLETE THE CHALLENGE AND SOLVE THE PUZZLE TO FIND THE FINAL LOCATION AND LOG THE CHALLENGE.&lt;/b&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The Bay Area has a wonderful puzzling community of both old and new puzzlers.  The camaraderie and support are inspiring.  That is lucky since puzzles here are often very challenging and sometimes require a meeting of the minds to solve. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For those out there that love the Unknowns (?) ~puzzle, mystery or challenge~ I present this cache.  It is a challenge I have completed myself with other 50 consecutive days of Unknown (?) solves and finds so I know just how tough it is, particularly in the area we live in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to qualify, you must:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Log online one month, 30 consecutive days of Unknown (?) caches. It can be any 30 day period, as long as it is consecutive. Crossing over months is okay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2. Include in your log the beginning and end days for your streak and the list of caches for each day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, for the fun! This is an Unknown (?) challenge after all and what would it be without a puzzle? It is not meant to be difficult so, if you need a hint, just let me know what you have tried and I will ty to help further your solution quest. The puzzle solves and challenges that I have completed have all been unique and interesting in their own ways and I have so many "favorites". Wish I could list them all here but had to limit it to the following few:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Everyday People                     3rd
Driftwood Revisited                 4th
Audio Cache                         4th
Finger Walking                      7th
It's Mad!                           5th
Black Adder                         6th
Future Masters (KPC2012)            7th
Baseball Dream Team                 3rd
Bear Creek Redwoods Challenge       3rd
Farmboy ...                         3rd
Patience                            5th
Code Breaker                        5th
Coin Trading                        4th
Reverse Geocache Puzzle Box         3rd
Looking Joint Probabilities         3rd
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a small camoed tupperware with a red lid. Please be kind to the vegetation in the area. Follow the hint so as to not do excessive damage. Replace the cache with the red lid up so the next cacher is able to find it easily.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Good Luck!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style="color:#8904B1;"&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;CONGRATULATIONS TO THE NORTH STAR ON FTF!!!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">&lt;p&gt;Since I do more puzzles than most, I thought I might have this in the bag already, but when I looked over my finds, I realized this was going to take a serious effort. At first, I rejected the idea, but then I saw kablooey dashing from one end of the bay area to the other to meet the challenge, and I realized I was just wimping out: this was a true challenge, reasonable and really quite worth the effort. By accident, I started just before heading back east for a week at my family's annual reunion, so I was faced with the fact that there just aren't that many unknown caches in central New Jersey. But with the support of my sister (cjp), brother-in-law (reschen), and my lovely assistant, I managed that week, and the rest seemed almost easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise turned out to be way more fun than I expected. And it gave me a good excuse to go further than normal to finally make the find on some of those pesky solved puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As often happens, I satisfied the requirements before I took a serious look at where the final was. Whoa, even further than any of the trips to fill in the days! The final puzzle was no problem: I've always expected to see that done. We enjoyed a wonderful hike in today's gorgeous weather to pick up the final. I've never been here before, so we also picked up all the other caches along the route. Thanks a lot.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">[brown]Was out grabbing the new Sandpipers II so decided I should walk a bit further to sign this one to provide me with a little incentive. It's amazing how a given distance on a flat wide open pathway through baylands seems infinitely longer than the same distance in the hills. I practically had enough time to contemplate, solve, and plan retrieval of the month's worth of puzzles. [;)]  The only problem is that I have a hard time resisting retrieval of enigmas after I solve them, especially if they are within easy striking distance. Most of the unretrieved puzzles in my solved queue either require a significant hike or a major road trip, e.g. Europe, to nab the prize. Plus I'm anxious to achieve the 1000 puzzle milestone so after that I will have to start stockpiling a pipeline of local solved puzzles to make a legitimate Puzzling Month attempt.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">09:07. Took me a while to find this one, even with all the hints. But mostly because I was not searching very quickly, and I spent most of my time in the wrong spot. There are lots of birds out, including some white birds which look familiar, but which I can't name, I think because they're not usually white. I tried to start a puzzle-finding streak in May, but it didn't last very long. My current streak started on June 1st and had to include a drive to Livermore when a puzzle cache disappeared in Milpitas and I didn't have any closer solves. So, I cursed this challenge many times, but it was actually good to get some of the long-hike solves done and clear out the rest of my local solved-but-not-found list. Saw wildbun and Motorbug out on the trail this morning after I made the find.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">A small cache that is part of a small series called Been Here, this
cache was placed to coincide with Earth Day 2006
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">     &lt;img src=
     "http://img.groundspeak.com/cache/55f4b9dd-0d04-4048-aba8-e99a0c607542.jpg"
     border="0" hspace="5" width="166" align="left"&gt;From the late
     1960s until the early 2000s, the buildings immediately on
     either side of this industrial park cul-de-sac housed
     microfilm coating, floppy disk coating, and other
     manufacturing operations. 
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, these operations were the source of various soil and
groundwater contamination incidents. Of all of the things that I
did here, I am most proud of my association and involvement with
the remediation efforts that culminated in the sites achieving
"cleaned up" status!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April of 1990, I took a transfer and a promotion to work at
the microfilm division here. I was the EHS (Environmental Health
and Safety) Manager and Facilities Manager. Later came an
additional title: Production Equipment Maintenance Manager. A
certain 40sumtin also wore many other interesting "hats" during
this time, but it was the experiences in environmental, health and
safety that were the most important for me and my future career
paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This decade was most definitely an odd experience overall,
dominated by the woman who managed the business. The operations
were tightly ruled by a control-freak whose management style was
described as "medieval European". Many of us referred to her as
"The Dragon Lady", and this was not a term of endearment. Her
management style was that every problem had as its root cause human
error for which the corrective actions usually included lengthy and
severe verbal tongue lashings by The Dragon Lady herself, not often
privately.&lt;/p&gt;
Microfilm, a once thriving industry, lost ground as a medium for
image management systems to digital applications throughout the
1990s. Microfilm usage world-wide dropped an average of 10% a year
throughout that decade. And as production shrank, operations were
consolidated into the now-demolished building to the west. During
this time, every year or so (or less) there would be another
layoff, another tightening of the fiscal belt, another
consolidation of responsibilities as the management team shrank.
But I always managed to miss the "down-sizing" axe. I would work
here until the end of 1999, at which time I would finally leave the
"company" with almost 20 years of seniority.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;A few short years later and the operations were closed for good.
And now even the building is gone. All that physically remains of
my decade of work here are clean soils, clean groundwater, and the
pink jasmine vines that I planted myself that still cling to the
Central Expressway fence to the west of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a bad legacy, actually, now that I think about it!
     &lt;img src='http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_wink.gif'
     border="0" align="middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cache&lt;/b&gt; should be easy enough to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Been Here series will probably include:&lt;br&gt;
Been Here: Walsh&lt;br&gt;
Been Here: Elko and Reamwood&lt;br&gt;
Been Here: Patrick Henry&lt;br&gt;
Been Here: Pastoria&lt;br&gt;
Been Here: East Java&lt;br&gt;
Been Here: Osgood&lt;/p&gt;
Enjoy! And happy caching!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To make the puzzle slightly easier, the cubes always have their
sides in the same place. ie. The red side is always facing you, or
in the middle of the net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This puzzle took a gargantuan amount of time to create, just
sayin'.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>[puzzle, 3.5 stars] Amazing how our technology and mathematics continues to advance over the years. This insight into Rubik's cubes is relatively new, and was just proved last year, in July. It was proven that God's number is 20. Modulo 10.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

Thankfully, times have changed, and I'd hoped to find another way to get this puzzle done. Nothing I tried seemed to work, although in the months that passed, I did actually hand-solve a real cube for my very first (and only) time! Finally, I compared notes with kanchan, he came up with a much better approach, and after a gajillion of s-l-o-w moves, I had coordinates! 

Thanks to the CO for the trip down memory lane and the unexpected chance to conquer what I'd always believed impossible. [:D]</groundspeak:text>

HALLOWEEN CACHE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;MUMMYWALE has faded behind the veil
once again.&lt;br /&gt;
The cache has assumed it's year round form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img style="float: right;" src=
"http://www.carkees.net/images/mummy.jpg" alt="Dancing mummy" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Halloween has come and gone. We now have to revert the
cache to its year round state. These coordinates lead directly to
the cache, which has a simplified version of the puzzle
element:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N 37.21.912&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;W 122.03.744&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="color: orange;"&gt;ORIGINAL TEXT FOR CACHE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: larger"&gt;Geocaching certainly brings a bit of
fun into the world, and takes you places at home and abroad just
about everywhere on this earthly plane of ours&amp;hellip;but has it
ever taken you to&amp;hellip;the other side? Mummy and Deady at
Mummywale feel it is time for an otherworldy cache and invite you
to come geocaching with the ghosts, goblins, and ghouls that roam
our fine street when the shroud between this world and the next is
most thin&amp;hellip;All Hallow&amp;rsquo;s Eve!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="color: orange;"&gt;JOIN US AT MUMMYWALE&amp;mdash;WE ARE JUST
DYING TO MEET YOU&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: larger"&gt;We here on this fine street in
Mummywale take our Halloween quite seriously. We are a two block
stretch with several major haunts (front yard set ups) and a
supporting cast of many spooky houses that decorate more than is
average (visit http://www.carkees.net/halloween/ for a sneak peek).
People have come from all around the Bay Area for over 17 years to
trick or treat on this street. We get over 1,000 trick or treaters
(yes we count! when you need that much candy, you have to) and
probably nearly 1,500&amp;ndash;2,000 in total on Halloween night. If
you are planning a trip here, know that we here at Mummywale set up
all month long, but the last week of the month is best to
experience the entire street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: larger"&gt;The Rickety Railroad train actually
runs only on Halloween night, though their light displays are up
much of the month and are well worth visiting after dark, even
without the railroad. But beware! On Halloween, the muggles leek
through into our spirit realm of Mummywale and are thick as, well,
wrappings on a mummy. So take great care if you come that
night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: larger"&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t make it by Halloween?
That&amp;rsquo;s okay, the spirits rearrange the dimensional portal so
that a little of Mummywale leaks through at the cache for the rest
of the year. The puzzle changes, so, if you want a second go at a
different word puzzle, have at it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="color: #22dd33"&gt;A SHADE OF HALLOWEEN HISTORY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: larger"&gt;This is a very special time of year,
with four special nights and days back to back, all generated by
association with Halloween:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color: #008800; margin-bottom: 6pt;"&gt;Mischief
Night&lt;br /&gt;
October 30&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: larger; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;Mischief night is an
obscure tradition that has roots that reach farther than you think.
It is a time when fairies curdled the milk, ghosts
&amp;ldquo;ride&amp;rdquo; horses to exhaustion, and things generally go
bump in the night! Originally it overlapped with Halloween on
October 31 but moved to a day earlier. On this night, spirits that
have slipped the veil into this world (or jokesters blaming said
spirits!) play such pranks as TP-ing trees, ding dong ditch, and
soaping car windshields. Perhaps the most famous Mischief Night
prank was the Orson Wells 1938 radio broadcast adaptation of War of
the Worlds, which caused widespread panic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color: #008800; margin-bottom: 6pt;"&gt;Halloween&lt;br /&gt;
October 31&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: larger; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;Once upon a time,
Halloween was a harvest festival of the Celts called Samhain. The
day marked the beginning of winter. It also it also was the
beginning of the new year, and more importantly the end of the old
one. Peoples then believed that when the year changed, the veil
between our world of the living and that of the dead grew
tremulously thin. Thus, spirits escaped their realm to visit ours.
Many Halloween traditions like wearing costumes and trick or
treating have their roots in the ancient traditions formed in this
early time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color: #008800; margin-bottom: 6pt;"&gt;All Saints
Day&lt;br /&gt;
November 1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: larger; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;All Saints day is
the day after Halloween when saints who have no other day dedicated
to them are worshiped. Samhain became All Hallows Eve around 600
A.D. when Pope Gregory the first declared that missionaries should
consecrate to Christ the trappings of pagan worship that kept
bleeding through into their efforts to bring Christianity to
Britain. So a sacred tree would be consecrated instead of chopped
down (thus we get Christmas trees) or the festival of Samhain gets
associated with All Saints Day and becomes the evening before a
hallowed day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 style="color: #008800; margin-bottom: 6pt;"&gt;All Souls Day&lt;br /&gt;
November 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: larger; margin-top: 0pt;"&gt;Plopping All Saints
Day down on Halloween didn&amp;rsquo;t have the mitigating effect that
the was hoped for. The association with a day of the dead was
apparently too strong to mitigate thusly, so in the ninth century,
another day was added to the calendar of holidays generated by
Halloween: All Souls Day. This was a Christian feast day devoted to
praying for the souls of the dead, which not only tied into the
spirit traditions preceding it, but reinforced those traditions
going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="color: #cc55ff;"&gt;GETTING DOWN TO BARE BONES: THE
CACHE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: larger"&gt;Eager to join us in the realm of the
undead? Okay then, let&amp;rsquo;s trick or treat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: larger"&gt;Trick and treat are the guiding
principals in this cache. You will start at one location and then
visit another to get at the treat&amp;hellip;and there are tricks along
the way! We suggest you plan a hour to complete this. It's not
tremendously hard (the hard rating is mostly because of time), and
if you come in two visits, it won't take overly long at the sites
because part of the puzzle can go home with you to do at your
convenience. Bring pencil, eraser, and reading glasses if ever you
use them. If you come at night, a tiny flashlight will be helpful
at one site. Finding this cache is a little thorny&amp;mdash;literally,
so you may also want a pair of gloves and to watch the little ones.
I trimmed most of the bramble back, but left a few leaves as
camouflage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: larger"&gt;From the initial waypoint you will
visit two other sites, all of which are less than 5 minutes walk
from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: larger"&gt;Site 1: the Mummywale Mayhem: a
Hag&amp;rsquo;s Tale gets you from the waypoint to the first site and
gives a little hint of what you are looking for. You need to look
for a new clue, which is hidden in plain sight (no looking or
touching under or around things is necessary).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: larger"&gt;Site 2: Here you have to find
something hidden, decode a puzzle, which Takes you to Site 3.
/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: larger"&gt;Site 3: the Rickety Railroad. You need
to look for a new clue, which is similar to the one found at Site
1. No touching anything is necessary here either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: larger"&gt;So, are you dying to get started?
Follow this clue&amp;hellip;if you dare!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p style="font-size: larger"&gt;Good luck, and may the spirits move
you&amp;hellip;and protect you. Goodness knows you&amp;rsquo;ll need that
here in Mummywale&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
There are quite a number of walkway cache hides in Sunnyvale, and
surrounding cities. I decided to join the throng.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 That said, I figured I needed to number my walkway hide, so I
chose #42. (I'm a HHGTTG fan, what can I say.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 So, have fun and remember, 'Don't panic!' Its an easy one.&lt;br /&gt;

 &lt;b&gt;EXTRA CREDIT:&lt;/b&gt; Do all the local walkway cache hides. See my
public bookmark list called, &lt;b&gt;'Wild About

I'm so sorry. Very sorry and lonely. Remorseful. Hungry. Dry. Gone
mad perhaps. Please save me or send help soon. I'm abandoned on a
lonely double dead end road. I am here, please come for me. Sorry
for my babble below. Now hurry please.&lt;br&gt;

stratus tots got a ministry at tupperware land. Motion in wine is
swell. Sticky insider oiled my goiter attractor. Clue. Simplifying
an inside curved trinity for soliciting our mimics. Now stripped of
attics, as if such friction was minimized when Mississippi lay
tattered and criticized for timing some light mass munitions around
tattoos and activating announced titles. End.&lt;br&gt;

I ask for hints, get hints, do a little more, get discouraged and ignore it for months.  Finally, I asked a previous finder for some help and she encouraged me to work it out, although it was quite difficult for me, and I got very stuck at one point.  But, I persevered through my difficulty and was rewarded with a bunch of information I had no idea how to utilize.  One more hint from a previous solver, and I was able to put the rest together and went out to make the find today.  Nearly as tricky finding legal parking as it was to solve the puzzle.  Anyway, Helen and her dots have been conquered, although my eyes will never get better!

A geofriend was able to correct the error of my ways and help set me straight.  Even then, I couldn't get past the spots before my eyes.  I struggled and thought I would never be able to solve it completely, even with knowing how to do it and having the first 9 coords under my belt. Helen might have had inertia but I certainly did not.  It got late and I got tired. The last 6 coords continued to elude me and bad thoughts began to dance through my head.  I knew it was time to quit so I went to bed and slept on it.  The next day dawned bright and I headed off to work, eager for the day to end so that I could resume my efforts.  This time, it all came clearly to me. Everything quickly fell in place and I discovered just how well constructed this puzzle is. In retrospect, I saw the hints that would have helped me cross the initial hurdle but hindsight is 20/20.  I wouldn't have been able to get there without help.

Picked up the nice size cache today and was happy that the find was much easier than the puzzle.  Thanks for this nicely crafted beauty that really drove me crazy!</groundspeak:text>

Most of the time that I cannot find a cache, it is because I am just not trying hard enough.  I decided to try harder on this one, and I glimpsed something which I knew was part of the solution.  Within seconds, I had figure out the hints, and, once I understood those, had the solution shortly thereafter.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;The Cache is not at the posted coordinates.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solve the puzzle below to harvest the actual coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;Before it became Silicon Valley, this area was known for its
bountiful fruit orchards. The dummy coordinates are on the former
grounds of what was once the biggest fruit cannery in the world
[&lt;i&gt;Ref. 1&lt;/i&gt;]. Little is preserved from that fruitful past but a
nearby historical landmark. (If you&amp;rsquo;re curious, you may want
to visit the nearby landmark and historical plaque at N37 22.874
W122 02.105, but that information will not help solve this
puzzle.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, while researching this area I became hungry
for some fruit cocktail and decided to make my own for canning. I
did make sure it met USDA standards for fruit cocktail so kept the
proportions within the specifications of the following table [Ref.
2]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fruit Ingredient&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;Percentage by weight must not be less
than&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;Percentage by weight must not be more
than&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pears&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;30%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;50%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Peaches&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;25%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;45%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Grapes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;6%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;16%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pineapple&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;6%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;20%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Cherries&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;2%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:center"&gt;6%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Here are my notes:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individual weights of the fruits were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AB lbs. of cherries, CD lbs. of pears, EF lbs. of pineapple, GH
lbs. of grapes and JK lbs. of peaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All weights are in whole pounds, no fractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the weight of peaches, the tens digit is equal to the ones
digit (i.e. J=K)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had exactly twice as much pears as pineapple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought 7 kg of cherries, but was snacking on them so they
didn't all get added in. Still, I put in as many of them as I could
while still meeting the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the weights was a prime number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had switched the weights of any two fruits, I would not
have met the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got done, I had more than my scale could weigh. I had to
borrow my eccentric neighbors scale. I ended up with 15 stone
total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that harvest of information, I&amp;rsquo;m sure it will be
easy as pie to figure out the coordinates of the cache, which is at
N37 BX.WFZ, W122 VG.EYX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;br /&gt;
V=J-K&lt;br /&gt;
W=D+A&lt;br /&gt;
X=D-H&lt;br /&gt;
Y=G-A&lt;br /&gt;
Z=C-E&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please bring your own pen as there was no room for one in the
cache. Tweezers will be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you solved it when it first came out - the new final
coordinates are offset from the old ones N+0.073 W-0.019. There is
new bonus info in Certitude.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Congratulations to Monsterblader for FTF!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=venona"&gt;Venona&lt;/a&gt;
placed a clue out here during his 2008 activities. On the walk out
here you pass all sorts of signs warning against photographing - or
sketching! - the nearby Lockheed Martin facility. How wonderfully
retro-Cold War! Then near this cache there is a locked gate to NASA
Ames/Moffett Federal Airfield too. One can just imagine the snarky
old Russian spy out here with some ancient, clanky ComBloc 35mm
film camera, hiding in the bushes, eagerly trying to capture
degenerate capitalist secrets. 
&lt;p&gt;This cache marks the ending intersection of this stretch of the
Bay Trail. Here you're surrounded by keep out signs - Moffett,
Lockheed, and the NWS which ironically allows only hunters with the
appropriate "red card", hmmm...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no need to trespass, annoy the neighbors, swim under or
hang off of the bridge, or anything like that. Dogs are allowed
here if on leash. The only access is from the east, on flat graded
dirt trails. The best parking is at the trailhead at the end of
Carl Road (see additional waypoint) which will make your walk/ride
to the cache about 1.2 miles. This is not a drive-up cache and you
cannot access it from Moffett or Lockeed property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This San Francisco Bay Trail has posted hours of 6:30am to
one-half hour after sunset. Please respect park hours and
rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of this cache is a tip of the hat to one of my
favorite movies. This bridge is really not too far at all. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;PA1J8H0 - Parking Area&lt;br /&gt;N 37° 25.137 W 122° 01.075&lt;br /&gt;Parking Area&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Part 1 closes at 6 p.m. and Part 2 is located outside the perimeter.

One of the dead is buried here. Check the photo to identify the plaque. With the dead year in the format ABCD, add .DAC to the triple-6 of the posted longitude's minute decimal. 

Go to N 37 23.890 (new lat), W 122 07.666+.DAC to find the offset magnetic micro. Only a RiteInRain logsheet; bring your own pen. Deadheads leave memorial items at Part 1.

I didn't see any way around it, so I just introduced her to geocaching and showed her the cache. She was pleasant and seemed interested, asking a lot of questions, but I have to admit I was a little unnerved when it occurred to her to ask what would happen if she stole the cache. I told her it would make us sad, and that seemed to satisfy her. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

This time, I worked on it a bit and ate a lot of Red Herring until I decided that it wasn't Easy as Red Herring.  One thing in particular bugged me.  Then, I read the hint. Aha! I think I've got it.  It turns out that I was now enjoying a much sweeter dish than Red Herring and had my plate cleaned a  short while after.  

Went out to find the cache this morning before work and came close to a DNF.  It seems that mother nature (or maybe another cacher) had helped out with the camo on this one since it hadn't been found in nearly six months.  As a last ditch effort, I went back to my initial search location, which also happened to be exactly where the coords took me and found the cache within seconds.  Why didn't I look there to start with?  Duh.......

Anyway, I want to say thanks.  This one was a fun and quick one and didn't give me a headache after all [:D].  Just the opposite.  It put a big smile on my face!</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;This cache is one of sixteen caches in the Light Rail Cache Series that you'll need to find in order to find the &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?ID=65323"&gt;seventeenth&lt;/a&gt; cache.&lt;/p&gt;

This station is located just south of 5th Ave on the West side of Mathilda.   This station also has a bus transit center located next to it.
&lt;hr /&gt;
Take a ride on the light rail.   These caches have been designed to get you out of your auto and spend some time on public transportation, but you do not need to ride on the light rail to find them.   Each of the sixteen caches has been placed near stations along the &lt;a href="http://www.vta.org/schedules/lr_interactive_map/lrBusMap.html"&gt;Santa Clara Valley Light Rail&lt;/a&gt; line.   Each cache can be logged on its own, but you'll need to find the first sixteen caches in order to obtain the coordinates for the seventeenth cache.   The log for each cache, except one, includes a numerical value or code word that is used to figure out the final coordinates for the seventeenth cache.

Legal parking is available on 5th Ave, to the East of Mathilda.  Even if you believe that you'll never try to find the seventeenth cache you should write down the code word and the station it was found at just in case you change your mind.   Please make a note in your remarks if you traveled to these caches by light rail shuttle.   Thanks for your visit.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A view of a historical mural and then a bike or walk  to the cache.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is a another cache located on the mile-long Bol Park - Arastradero Ave. Bike/Pedestrian Path  that is located somewhere between Bol Park at N37 24.746 W 122 08.405 and Arastradero Rd. at N37 23.969 and W122 08.057. Parking is best found at Bol Park. 

To find this cache you will first have to visit a wonderfully done mural by Morgan Bricca depicting Juana Briones de Miranda (1804-1889) and the ranch lands she once owned in the Palo Alto and Los Altos hills area. There are two other nearby geocaches that cover other aspects of her life in this area (GCV2D5 - Juan Find a Cache? and GC13994- Juana Briones Slept Here). One is located at a state erected memorial plaque and the other at Juana Briones Park. 

To find this Juana Multcache you will need to locate a mural at the coordinates listed and answer some questions to determine the final cache coordinates. The final coordinates of the cache are within a half mile as the crow flies, but a lot farther by road and path. I recommend a bike for this one.

Please note the mural is on an exterior wall of the school named after Juana in Palo Alto. It is also the starting point of the famous spring "Juana Run?" fund raiser for the local schools. Plan your visit time carefully. A member of the public is NOT allowed to enter the campus between school hours of 8 AM and 3 PM Monday -Friday without registering with the school office. At all other times between sunrise and sunset and all day on weekends, members of the public may enter the grounds. Plan your visit accordingly.

When you place yourself at the coordinates listed you will see a large mural containing large number of people and animals. 

Let A be the number of coyotes in the foreground
Let B be the number of doors on roofed structures
Let C be the number of hoofed animals in the foreground only (ignore those in the distance)
Let D be the number of people in the foreground only (ignore those in the distance)

Check sum A+B=C+D=F

Let E = B-A-C

Checksum A+B+C+D+E+F=15

The coordinates of the cache are
N37 24.CEF
W122 08.DDD
to an accuracy of 12 feet.


Cache was originally a hanging decon container, but muggles have moved in to the original location. Cache is now a 3/4 in. diam. by 2 1/2 in. long match box container. Log only, so bring pen.

Waited until today to find and log the cache.  Wanted it to be on a special day.  This is the last cache I needed for the Neglected Cache Challenge.   A very special achievement for me.

Thanks for the fun and great day!   TFTC SL</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So, last night I was looking at this puzzle again, and this time, I managed to finish the first stage. Previously I had only 1/2 of it done.

Then I looked at the second stage and started scratching my head. Tried a few things that didn't pan out. Then I started reading the logs, and noticed Geo Fan found this. Hmm... maybe I can hit him up for a hint. What? He got the hint from me?? Wait a minute... oh yeah, CBF gave me a hint on this one a long time ago, but I did not make use of it because I wanted to try to solve more of it first before I used it.

So I dug out that old email, and it basically spelled out what I needed to do for stage 2. In hindsight, I might have been able to figure it out if I did a careful analysis of the puzzle, but that step required a leap of intuition that I may not be capable of making.

Came by today to sign the log on the nicely hidden cache. Had to walk a couple of rounds inspecting the object before I spotted it. Thanks for the puzzle and cache!</groundspeak:text>

At time of placement, cache contained: 1 Log sheet &amp;amp; standard

beyond the fence. Don't trample the little plants please. (None of
the preceding information will help you solve the puzzle or find

need to solve this one. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;font color="BLUE"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Update 10/16/03: Nostrada made me aware of
one potential limitation to solving this cache. At the risk of
giving away an obvious clue, we must offer another tip. For some
users of advanced browser toolage, to prevent Patience from turning
into Endless &amp;amp; Undeserved Frustration you must
"unfreeze".&lt;br /&gt;
 Update 4/18/04: after 6 months, we think it's fair to reduce the

required.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">15:47. Okay, well I'm not going to claim to have seen this idea used for a puzzle before. According to my puzzle log, it seems I've been looking at this about twice a month since it was published last July. I even solved two other puzzles using the same subject along the way. Meanwhile, mokelly has been consistently trying to give me really small nudges all along the way. They've been really, really small nudges. The kind you don't even feel. Finally, he gave me a slightly bigger nudge. It still took me a couple of hours to see what that nudge meant, and I still got stuck on the puzzle for 24 hours. Finally, last night, I managed to figure out a method to get over the last hurdle. I still don't understand the meaning of the method (which probably means there's a simpler method that I just don't see), but I was able to use it to get coordinates that Homer liked. Stopped by today with an empty wallet and my fuel light on. Lots of muggles passing through the area, but none that gave me any trouble, as I tromped around. Had to go back when I realized that I didn't have the tracking code from the Puppy Pound geocoin that I dropped into the cache. Added a little more camo. I guess I have to find some other mokelly puzzle to obsess about now (there are still plenty to choose from).

Our mini-cachers wanted to place a cache to celebrate the lives of two of our dogs who recently passed away.  Gunnar and Rory were small, feisty, red dogs who brought us much love and joy -- Gunnar for over 15 years and Rory for over 14 years.  When they were younger, Gunnar and Rory loved to hike and explore the outdoors.

Buster, our white geodog, is the newest member of The Red Rovers.  We were visiting the nearby business getting his dog license and thought it would be a good place for Gunnar and Rory's cache.  

You are looking for a small, sign only, camo’d micro.  Please bring a pen.

There is a public parking area located a leisurely walk away (see waypoint).  The parking area is closed from Sunset to 8 am.

Then a pair of muggle decided to have lunch right in their car and another pair decided to sit and chat on the bricks. 

Had to go away and get another cache first.  Came back and still had to wait for muggles to clear. 

Finally singed the log around 18:15.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Indicative of the higher rating, this crossword puzzle took longer to complete and was a little bit harder than the last one (Oxymorons) that I solved. Working on a paper copy, I started it during lunch and finished it up at home. There was one word that could be spelled two different ways so this caused trouble with another word that I wasn’t familiar with. Thanks to the “Congratulations!” message, I was able to discover this word and learned something in the process. Before now, I had never heard the song that your sister sang to you. This added a fun and personal touch to the puzzle. This was the third day in a row that I found a cache by this CO; a personal record [:D]. TNLNSL TFTC #1063</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This is a simple multi-cache intended to get you to visit one of our favorite local places for art: &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.blachschool.org"&gt;Blach Intermediate School&lt;/a&gt;. The cache is a micro, located slightly off campus. You will visit the murals in any order to identify its coordinates.
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">When we first noticed the mural gallery, this middle school had more than 60 reproductions of great works of art, painted by students under the supervision of one of the teachers. In the summer of 2001, the school was renovated, and only a few of the murals were preserved. Today less than a third remain, but they are still worth a visit.
&lt;p&gt;As Chris said on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://mydruthers.com/art.html"&gt;his web page&lt;/a&gt; about the murals, we like these reproductions because they remind us that &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;the art is in your mind&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. You have to already be familiar with the works depicted to understand why they are considered great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start at the front of the school at the coordinates posted above. Notice how the point of the building's roof that sticks out is used. (This is no longer a clue, but I still wanted to point it out.)&lt;/p&gt;
Before you walk down the main corridor, go to N 37° 21.844 W 122° 04.958. The number of muralists listed here is B.
&lt;p&gt;Now walk down the main corridor and around the quad and examine the murals for answers to the following questions. The answers are not intended to be tricky. Identifying the correct painting for each answer should be the hardest part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two adjacent pictures from a popular children's book. A is the number of muralsts involved in reproducing the older one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C relies on two works that have recently appeared. Look for Georgia O'Keefe's "Red Canna", (behind a fence) then follow that wall around to the right. The second painting you come to is a still life. C is the digit that appears the most times in that painting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a painting by one of the doors to room B4, what is being held by the subject of the picture? (This is D.) Is it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7: a purse&lt;br /&gt;
8: a musical instrument&lt;br /&gt;
9: an umbrella&lt;br /&gt;
0: flowers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E is the number of muralists from 1981 listed on the painting situated between Edward Hicks'"Peacable Kingdom" and Manet's "The Fifer".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F is the number of points on the highest "star" in the blue painting directly across from the detail from Dali's "Persistence of Memory".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is located at 37 21.ABC 122 04.DEF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blach School welcomes visitors when school is not in session: weekends, after 4pm, and most of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added August 31, 2003:&lt;/b&gt;(Sorry mmp; I forgot until after the FTF.) There's a bonus here for the first several cachers to show up with cameras. There's a virtual cache &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?ID=18348"&gt;"Murals Across America"&lt;/a&gt;, for which you just have to be the first to take a picture of a particular mural (and your GPSr). I've already logged one of these murals, but the rest are still up for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added September 8, 2003:&lt;/b&gt; In response to a few comments, we have clarified the questions for Answers C and E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added November 5, 2004:&lt;/b&gt; The painting for F is gone, so the clue has been changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added June 19, 2005:&lt;/b&gt; As shadow101 pointed out, the final cache location is not wheelchair accessible, but you can get within 10 feet of it. Wheelchair-users who are caching with others should be able to enjoy this cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added March 5, 2006:&lt;/b&gt; Another work used as a signpost has disappeared. I've rewritten the clue for F to not rely on the missing works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added October 12, 2009&lt;/b&gt;We moved the cache off campus and changed a few of the clues to use new murals and point to the current location.&lt;/p&gt;

"Oh, girls, I'm really not sure about that... I think creating a puzzle is hard."&lt;br /&gt;
"Can't we do one for kids? Won't that be easy? It's gotta have clues to follow and find, just like when we go geocaching!"&lt;br /&gt;
"Well, I'll see what I can do. But what about coordinates? Grown-ups like that."&lt;br /&gt;
"Why does that matter?! We want to pick the place to hide it, and we want to be able to find it with just the clues. Please, Mama, pleeeeeeease?"&lt;br /&gt;
"Alright... I will try my best."&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Snips and Snails&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;There once was a food Shop in town,&lt;br /&gt;
Which after 60 years was all run-down.&lt;br /&gt;
S.S.S. had a dream,&lt;br /&gt;
To make it supreme,&lt;br /&gt;
And now it's a spot of renown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Just left, there's a sidewalk in place,&lt;br /&gt;
That curves to a rather strange space.&lt;br /&gt;
It directs you to plants,&lt;br /&gt;
So I hope there's not ants.&lt;br /&gt;
Just reach out for the cache that you chase.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use the clues in the limerick to search for and find the location, and go there to find the cache. If you want to verify the location, you can enter its current name in &lt;a href="http://certitude.comxa.com/certitude.php?wp=GC2W8C2&amp;amp;v=1"&gt;certitude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Solved this a few months ago and looking at the waypoint on the car GPSr, I wasn't sure we were headed to the right place but when we got there, it was.  Pretty quick find, too, although there were lots of pedestrians and cars, making retrieval and replacement a bit time-consuming.  It was a shame that we didn't get to go inside because it closed after we drove up but before we got out of the car and walked over - oh, well.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">“Hello, Charles. Why the stormy brow?”
&lt;p&gt;Lord Peter Wimsey had paid a call upon Chief-Inspector Charles Parker of Scotland Yard, who was his brother-in-law.
&lt;p&gt;“Hello, Peter. It's just the latest torment from that Hanratty fellow, from America. Ever since we were on the Allied staff together during the Great War, he has been sending me the story of his latest triumph over crime and challenging me to tell how he did it. The man seems most insufferably pleased with himself.”
&lt;p&gt;“And what is the latest, pray tell?”
&lt;p&gt;“It seems that California is a hotbed of crime nowadays. No sooner had he done away with the 
&lt;A href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=2076b33c-c006-4b87-9e77-6b7dbe093885"&gt;
K3 Gang&lt;/A&gt; 
of bootleggers than the K2 Gang of drug-smugglers took their place. Look at these newspapers he's sent me.” 
&lt;p&gt;Parker gestured at a copy of the San Francisco Chronicle for August 15, 1929; its headline read “Graf Zeppelin Attempts Flight Around World”. Alongside it on the desk lay the following day's Chronicle opened up to the classified advertising section.
&lt;p&gt;“For some time he and his men had been trying to discover how the head of this gang was informing the underlings, without ever meeting in person, where to collect their hidden drug packets."
&lt;P&gt;"Then one day a source at the newspaper told him that every Thursday morning, about an hour after the paper was out on the streets, an unknown caller would telephone to place a classified advertisement to appear the following day. And it was always a very queer sort of advertisement. Look.” Parker pointed to an ad circled in red pencil. It read:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;font face="Courier"&gt;
odious&lt;br&gt;
FAWTVKWXTWATHHDDFFNA&lt;br&gt;
HWQIZJZVKZLENNJWQPJL&lt;br&gt;
UMMNNZNSUNSSNANSZRMS&lt;br&gt;
GCCISCSUESSGIRBJCAGS&lt;br&gt;
XGRBVRQHCLVMWCOPWCLV&lt;br&gt;
HIHXIICKIOMXPZXEMXON&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Very curious indeed,” said Lord Peter, his nose twitching with interest. “It certainly looks like a cipher. Do you know what kind?”
&lt;p&gt;“We are informed that a 
&lt;A href="http://www.cryptogram.org/cdb/aca.info/aca.and.you/chap07.html"&gt;
type K2 substitution cipher&lt;/A&gt;
is definitely involved, at least in part. It's a hallmark of that gang. In this method, the ordinary alphabet is substituted-for by a scrambled cipher alphabet that is prepared using a keyword.”
&lt;p&gt;“For example, if 'odious' were the keyword, the cipher alphabet would begin with that word, leaving out the duplicate letter 'o': 
&lt;font face="Courier"&gt;ODIUS.&lt;/font&gt;
Then the unused letters of the alphabet would follow in order, still without duplicates: 
&lt;font face="Courier"&gt;ODIUSABCEFGHJKLMNPQRTVWXYZ&lt;/font&gt;.”
&lt;p&gt;“I've tried deciphering the message using the normal plain-text alphabet and that cipher alphabet:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font face="Courier"&gt;
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&lt;br&gt;
ODIUSABCEFGHJKLMNPQRTVWXYZ&lt;/font&gt; &lt;br&gt;
so that every 'O' in the cipher text comes from an 'a' in the plain text, every 'D' from 'b' and so on. But the result was all rubbish.”
&lt;p&gt;“A sensible, if inauspicious start,” said Lord Peter. “But did you try any of the other rotations of the same cipher alphabet, in the same sequence but with different initial letters, such as 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;font face="Courier"&gt;
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&lt;br&gt;
ABCEFGHJKLMNPQRTVWXYZODIUS&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
or&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font face="Courier"&gt;
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&lt;br&gt;
BCEFGHJKLMNPQRTVWXYZODIUSA&lt;/font&gt; ?”
&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” groaned Parker. “I tried them all. But none of them are any good. I know that the K2 method has to be part of it, but there must be something else they've done to complicate the cipher, and I simply don't see what it is or how the gang members would find any keywords to work it. I'm at my wits' end. Blast that confounded Hanratty!”
&lt;p&gt;“Now, now, Charles,” said Lord Peter. “Tears, idle tears ..... Wait a moment! This reminds me of the way we solved the affair of Major Tod Milligan and his dope-ring. Let me see those newspapers.”
&lt;p&gt;Lord Peter took a fresh sheet of paper, uncapped his fountain pen and started writing, looking back and forth between the newspapers.
&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes' work he frowned. “Oh, dear. I was quite sure I understood how this scheme worked, but the line I've produced so far doesn't look at all like the kind of message we're looking for.
Still, let's keep on and see where we get.” 
&lt;p&gt;Several minutes later Lord Peter's worksheet bore six complete rows of letters looking very much like the ones in the newspaper. &lt;br&gt;
“Peter, it looks like so much rubbish again. This is discouraging,” sighed Parker.
&lt;p&gt;The two men stared silently at the worksheet. Then, Lord Peter's face lit up in a sudden smile.
&lt;p&gt;“Charles! Oh, ye of little faith! It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the message we've been looking for. You just have to look at it in the right way, do you see?” Lord Peter waggled his hand at the letters.
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, yes, now I see it. 'Degrees' ... 'minutes' ... and I think they sound just right for California.”
&lt;p&gt;“This is splendid, Charles. We shall go to my club and celebrate with a bottle of fizz. And then you must tell me what other interesting cases you've been working on.”
&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
If you're curious to know what Lord Peter Wimsey recalled about Major Milligan's drug ring, you can read about it in Dorothy L. Sayers' mystery novel &lt;i&gt;Murder Must Advertise&lt;/i&gt;, published in 1933. &lt;br&gt;
But you don't need to read that to solve the puzzle. All the key information you need is in the story; you just need to work out how to use it.
&lt;p&gt;The cache container is a magnetic key case. The location is likely to be pretty busy during the day most days, but you could probably still pull off a stealthy grab if you palm the container while feigning interest in the item it's attached to.&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I've pondered long and hard over this one. Really long. Like, more than 1.5 years. It was the closest unfound (posted coordinates) puzzle to my office. I tried many things, and none panned out. I even bought the book, and it didn't reveal that much to me about the puzzle [:)]

Finally, I broke down and asked the CO about what I've done. He was very helpful, pointing out where I went wrong. Shelved it for a couple of weeks, then pulled it out again today to look at it. Second thing I tried today worked, and I got the coordinates!

I tried cryptanalysis on the text, and got nowhere with that. However, in the process, I gained a couple of new skills with cryptanalysis. Which, really, is not that surprising, considering I'm starting with very little [:)] Maybe these skills will come in handy on another puzzle.

I came by when I thought there should be few people around. Still more crowded than I anticipated. Someone thoughtfully provided a plastic ziploc bag to protect the cache. Unfortunately, the bag trapped a good amount of water in it. The inside of the cache, however remained dry, much to my pleasant surprise. I got rid of the bag since it is quite disgusting, and rain season is over. Thanks for teaching me a few new tricks, and for your help in telling me where I veered from the path on this one.

 This cache is an easy micro that provides you with a unique
perspective of local history. Original cache contents: a log sheet
and one smashed penny from the Wildcat Railroad in Los Gatos,CA.
Nothing more than that will fit in the cache. Its small! Bring your
own pen.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Cache is located at a business development park that includes the
historical landmark. Recommend that you do this cache before or
after standard business hours, 8am - 5pm. (However, based on the
logs so far, there doesn't appear to be a problem if you choose to
go for this cache during a lunch time cache run.) There are parking
restrictions in the area. Be mindful where you park.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For history on the landmark make sure to see the nearby heritage
plaque at: N 37 22.878 W 122 02.106&lt;br&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">
      </groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;It's time for our second safety themed geocache series. This
time around the theme is Hand Safety! We can't reach our goal of
ZERO injuries until we eliminate ALL hand injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hand Safety cache series was placed with your safety in
mind. The physical cache is a tupperware container located adjacent
to the Sunnyvale Water Treatment ponds. Please keep in mind that
there is a healthy gopher snake population in the area, and at
times the bugs are thicker than the smell. Safety glasses are not
an uncommon sight on these trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself slipping, tripping, or falling during your
search for this cache, you're looking in the wrong place. You'll
only need to move an object that weighs a few pounds, but please
check carefully for any of the local wildlife that might not have
needed to move an object to enter this hiding place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this cache is to provide the understanding that
it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to PREVENT yourself from FALLING, than it is
to remember the 10 THINGS you need to do WHILE you are FALLING that
will help prevent injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the 10 things you can do WHILE you are FALLING to
minimize hand injuries (not in any order of importance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Tuck your chin in&lt;br /&gt;
2. Turn your head&lt;br /&gt;
3. Throw an arm up&lt;br /&gt;
4. Twist or roll your body to the side&lt;br /&gt;
5. Keep your wrists bent&lt;br /&gt;
6. Keep your elbows bent&lt;br /&gt;
7. Keep your knees bent&lt;br /&gt;
8. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to break the fall with your hands&lt;br /&gt;
9. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to break the fall with your elbows&lt;br /&gt;
10. Have as many square inches of your body contact the surface as
possible to spread out the impact&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we can all agree that it&amp;rsquo;s much easier to just NOT
FALL. It&amp;rsquo;s instinctive for us to stick our hands out during a
fall, and our hands and wrists are just not designed to absorb the
massive shock that occurs in some instances. During the last Beyond
Safety cache series, a cache was placed entitled &amp;ldquo;Slips,
Trips, and Falls.&amp;rdquo; The cache description discussed some of
the interesting methods used in the Beyond Safety workplace at Ames
(See link below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the entire Hand Safety series:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This multi-cache will bring you into a very long but narrow park
in Los Altos. All waypoints including the final cache location are
at this park. The final cache location may be busy at certain times
on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;11/06/06&lt;/b&gt; - The city has removed one waypoint so this has
been shorted by one stop and the formula adjusted. Final remains in
the same place. I'll watch the old waypoint location and see if
anything replaces it.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The park is open everyday from 6 am to 9 pm. Please cache
only during these hours.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Look at how the pieces of tube, each about 3 feet long, form a
pattern of streets in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; = the number of intersections between the
tubes with 4 or more tubes coming together.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The person who holds a computer in one hand, holds a musical
instrument in the other hand. This instrument is a 6-letter word.
Using the simple substitution A=1, B=2, ...:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt; = 1st letter of that instrument converted to a
digit - 4&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt; = 3rd letter of that instrument converted to a digit -

I had seen some of these pieces of art from the expressway but never up close. Like some other cachers, we initially made an error on the first number, but once we read some logs and realized that the final location had to be in the park, it was obvious what that number had to be. BTW, I'd definitely call the cache container "Small," not "Micro," so adjust your search activities appropriately.</groundspeak:text>

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;This cache is located in the Palo Alto Baylands Park. You’ll find plenty of parking if you choose the Terminal Blvd. trail entrance. It’s nearly a 3 mile round trip from the parking lot, but the trail is flat, and the bird watching is second to none. Be prepared to find several other caches along the way, and please bring your pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s fitting that from this cache location you’ll learn the importance of the complex “Interrelationships” between wetlands plants and animals, and that CARE must be taken to protect these sometimes fragile relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look across the wetlands from this spot you’ll see NASA Ames Research Center and its many unusual looking structures. Those unique structures include the historic Unitary Plan Wind Tunnels, the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (the world’s largest wind tunnel), and the amazing Arc Jet Complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workforce of NASA Ames includes a mixture of Civil Servant and Contract employees. Just like the complex relationships that exist between the plants and animals of the wetlands, CARE must be taken to protect the “Interrelationships” of the Ames workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One contract company at Ames, Jacobs, believes that if a workforce CARES about eachother, they'll be less likely to allow eachother to be injured. This “Culture of Caring" mindset is called Beyond Zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond Zero Is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- First and foremost about being injury and incident free&lt;br /&gt;
- An integral approach to being injury and incident free&lt;br /&gt;
- Our expectations starting with not getting injured&lt;br /&gt;
- Not allowing others around you to be injured&lt;br /&gt;
- Not allowing unsafe practices, behaviors, or conditions to continue&lt;br /&gt;
- Expecting leadership to achieve these goals and to be personally accountable&lt;br /&gt;
- Knowing that using processes and procedures gives us a better chance of avoiding accidents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beyond Zero “BZ” Walking Club was spawned from this mindset of CARING. Each time the BZ Walking Club meets, those workplace “interrelationships” are strengthened. These relationships are critical in a work environment that relies on teamwork and CARING as essential elements of the injury prevention program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BZ Walking Club walks the Baylands Preserve @ 4pm on most Wednesday afternoons between March and October, and at 11am at other Bay Area parks on the last Saturday of each month.&lt;/p&gt;

After perhaps 6 hours of research (mostly spent trying to dig up archived caches and establish a timeline to recreate the environment when this one was placed) I identified 7 general areas where the cache could legally be, some of them quite large. Today I went by 4 of them and spent two hours hiking and searching in this park. I hadn't been here since I found The Dump in 2002  and was not familiar with the access points so I ended up parking in what was probably the farthest possible point from the area I wanted to search. So 6 hours of work, maybe more, and 0 finds. That's a pretty standard ROI on a OAP cache.</groundspeak:text>

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;As I approached the Goodwill truck with several bags of old
clothes I intended to donate, I noticed the clerk, a rather
ancient-looking black man. Despite his age he was listening to an
iPod and tapping his toes in a lively fashion. He must have been
hard of hearing as the volume was cranked up so loud I could hear
the buzzing from his earbuds even from several feet away. He
greeted me warmly and removed his earbuds as I plopped the bags on
the counter, but as he began to pull out my old cast-offs he looked
somewhat disapprovingly. This was Los Altos, after all, and they
were more interested in designer dresses worn once than the cheap,
worn-out stuff I was offering. As he was examining the bags I asked
for a tax receipt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You're going to take a charitable deduction for THIS?" he said,
holding up a tattered T-shirt I got as a souvenir on a trip to New
York. The picture on the front was a photo of the old Ziegfeld
Theater from the 1950s. "That was a great musical, though," he
offered, pointing to the name on the marquee. "I saw that after I
got out of the army."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You're a fan of the theater, then?" I replied, trying to keep
the surprise out of my voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The theater, movies, music of all kinds, dance, opera, even the
circus," he answered. "I'm something of a cognoscente of all the
performing arts."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well I know my old clothes are more suitable for washing cars
than being resold, but I still need my receipt," I declared,
impatient to get going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He obviously pegged me for the cheapskate I am, more interested
in the tax deduction that helping out the Goodwill. "I tell you
what," he said, holding up that T-shirt. "Let's play word
association. I'll say a word, or the beginning of a word, and you
guess the second part to complete the word or phrase I'm thinking
of. If you can get fifteen right, I'll give you your receipt. I'll
make the first one easy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no choice so I went along. The first few were easy enough,
but then I got stuck. After a bit of quiet contemplation, though, I
finally realized what was going through his head. I needed a lot of
extra guesses here and there, but he let me guess as often as
necessary on the harder ones, and I eventually got them all. As he
handed me the receipt, he nodded his head respectfully and said, "I
guess you're something of a cognoscente, too. Maybe I'm a bit
prejudiced, but I didn't take you for someone who would know
those."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I got home and did a little research I realized that the
answers led to a perfect geocache hiding location, so I placed one
there. If you want to play the same game, you can by clicking the

[I believe that if you solve it, you will know your solution is
correct, so I'm not putting a coordinate checker up yet, but if I
find that people are getting alternate solutions without any
mistakes in their method, I will do so later. At least until the
first few finds, I will not be confirming coordinates.]

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I looked at this one when it first came out but, as a new cacher and even newer puzzler, I didn't stand a chance.  Tried it again about a year ago and, with a bit of help, got the first word.  And...stopped.  Every once in a while, I would go back and try some more but couldn't seem to make it any further.  A couple of days ago, a geofriend gave me a bit of a nudge that helped me to the second word. The 3rd came quickly and I thought that I had the theme...FINALLY.  Oh no, that wasn't the case.  Stuck on number 4.  Mulled it over for a while, tried a few things, did a bit of research but just couldn't get past it.  At last, the same geofriend nudged me again.  You could say he made it impossible for me to not know what it was. The next one came quickly and then, suddenly, I saw the theme!  How exciting! And it was there on the cache page the whole time!  You sneaky Rat!  I just didn't see it.  But "hindsight is 20/20" isn't it?  

I quickly raced through the remaining associations, eager for the prize at the end. I didn't get quite what I expected and, to tell the truth, still don't understand the meaning.  A cruel joke perhaps?  After mulling over what I had a while longer, an idea came to me.  I followed it through and soon had coords that matched the checksum.  WooHoo!  What a fun puzzle!

Stopped at GZ today and found a cache. But, wait....the name is not Word Association.  I was so confused.  The names on the log didn't seem right either.  I got out and went right to the spot where the coords were pointing me and found a second container.  This one had the right name on it and some signatures I was familiar with from the log page.  Signed and headed happily on my way thinking of rags and goodwill before my mind moved on to various other things that weren't related to this puzzle......</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Apparently I’m not a “cognoscente of all the performing arts” [:I] since I quickly ran into a wall 1/5 of the way through. The problem was that based on the first three associations and the description I had another theme in mind and this impeded my progress ever since the puzzle was published 9 months ago [:(]. I’m not sure what was different when I revisited the puzzle over the weekend but I quickly discovered the intended theme and breezed though the word associations almost as fast as I could type.  Although I had a bit of issue with one of the digits, thanks to the checksum and google maps, I was able to resolve the conflicting information without much effort. Thanks to the CO for confirming my solution.
Mrs. TNS had an appointment in Ladera so we made a very slight detour to stop by the final location and I found the cache right where my GPSr indicated it should be. Thanks a fun puzzle. I liked the unique theme and implementation [^]. This cache fills in one of the 25 missing days on my Finds for each Day of the year. TNLNSL TFTC #955</groundspeak:text>

Finally I was able to find the association that had held me back, and I was able to get the rest without much difficulty. Solved this a couple of months before I managed to stop by for the find. When I arrived at the site, it looked familiar... so much so that I first retrieved a different container. When I looked at the log, however, I knew it was not for this puzzle. I searched some more and soon found the correct container. Thanks for the puzzle and cache!</groundspeak:text>

Kids." Well, I don't have kids, so I had to solve all those puzzles
using the knowledge in my own brain, which was simple because I am
very knowledgeable in the inner workings of the Pokemon games.
&lt;p&gt;There's an entire underground community of "professional" (if
they can so be called) Pokemon battlers and manipulators, who play
the game almost as a competitive sport. This puzzle requires some
basic knowledge of Advanced Pokemon manipulation, and the easiest
way to solve it, is to Ask a Master.&lt;/p&gt;

I noticed the final location on my GPSr map after I entered the coordinates and thought I knew the hide location. I was a bit surprised when my GPSr led me away from a more visible (and red) object.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I had some free time at work this week and decided to work on some puzzle caches.  Since I haven't solved too many puzzles, I've been working on 2 and 3 star puzzles.  The other logs mentioned how easy this puzzle was, so I decided to try it.  I probably spent around 2 hours looking at, trying to figure out what to do.  Eventually I noticed something interesting about the first number on each line and then it was a quick solve.  I felt pretty dumb that it took me so long to solve this one.  When we got to the cache location, there were some muggles sitting right next to where the cache was, so we had to be really stealthy about retrieving the cache.  Thanks for the fun puzzle!</groundspeak:text>

I did a quick search of nearby caches as I drove down 101, and this one looked like a quick grab.  I stopped by and was thrown for a loop at first, thinking I had entered the wrong coords in the GPS'r.  After a few minutes I decided to take a step back and take in the surroundings.  That did the trick as I was able to spot the caches hiding spot.

I solved the original, so solving this puzzle was no problem, but admittedly I never found the original cache before it was archived.  Thanks!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">&lt;b&gt;Cache is not at the title, but is at the posted coords. This is
as close as I could get without disturbing the neighbors.&lt;/b&gt;
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This was the second house I lived in during my younger years. This
actually is the only house on Rixford yet our address was Parma.
The other house at the corner is on Parma. How and who named the
street Rixford is still a mystery to me. If you wish to see the
house it is best to park on Parma and walk ONLY to the entrance
past the Parma house. &lt;b&gt;Please do not go any further for the
owner's privacy. The house of course has been updated since we
moved out.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father built this house back in the mid 50's when our other
house became too small for our family. William P. Ellis didn't
intend to be a builder. But he did go to Stanford to be an
engineer. After my mom and dad had my oldest sister, he built a
bigger house for themselves. Someone saw it and wanted to know if
he would sell it to him. So my dad sold it. Okay now he had to
build another house. He realized then that this was something he
could do, Build houses. (that story may continue)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our home had two stories which my father used the second story
as a den. And we had a circular fireplace in the center of the
grand room. The creek you see at the posted coords runs along most
of the drive way and along the backyard. We had two backyards, one
for my mom's garden and one for my dad to work on projects and make
mulch for my mom's garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom had a good friend who lived on the other side of the
creek from the house. She had to walk to Covington and back on
Riverside to visit her. So my dad built a bridge across the creek
as a present. The tree house was built later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One good memory I have living here was that my mom used to walk
to the Rancho Shopping Center a lot with my baby sister and me. I
guess it stuck with me because one day my sister and I (while I was
about 6) somehow walked all the way from the house to the Rancho
Shopping Center and to the Bakery (not the one there now). The
baker saw us and had to call my mom and while we waited he gave us
a cookie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At night we would hear the train going by that is occupied by
the Foothill expressway now.&lt;br /&gt;
I also use to play down in the creek here, so if you know me and
know how I love to pick up lizards, frogs and snakes (except
rattlers) this is where it all started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I would try something different or old school as the
case may be. We have been by here while caching so may times I have
lost count. This is just a simple hide of a regular size container
with the usual toys. Not a nano, micro or even a small. It is
hidden in an area I think is worth bringing cachers back to. I hid
this regular size cache close to an area with plenty of muggle
traffic. If swarms of cachers went after this, muggles would surely
see them, and the area would become worn and unable to hide a
regular sized cache so I made this a puzzle. I hiked in on path
just past the PA veterinary clinic to the posted coords about a
tenth of a mile past the last cache and was surprised by what I
found. If you go there you won't find this cache, but this is what
you will find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Thinking about the nearby Ceara Cache! and finding these unexpected
palms I knew I was in a place Big Checker would like. I thought
about a Kid Cache, brought to you by the number 7, kid stories, and
was reminded of a line one ate A Fig. Quickly I realized I was
confusing Figs with Dates and that these aren't even date palms. I
felt rather silly and wondering why 7 is lucky, I knew I needed to
get out of the summer sun. The cache is a large, at least a gallon,
plastic jar covered with camo tape. When placed, it was just
standing there within a thicket, not buried or covered by sticks or
rocks. I placed it standing upright to keep water out and hope
cachers attempt to keep it standing or I may need to replace it
with something that would likely be even harder to spot. Although
it is only a couple yards from where muggles may be, it is hidden
even tougher than I had expected. This probably could have been a
large bucket, so we will see how the area fairs before I attempt an
upgrade. My Garmin 60CSx takes me right to the spot, and the cache
is very obvious when you are close to ground zero. This is a kid
cache and contents are the usual toys with a pen and pencil for you
to sign with. Aside from the thicket this is in, the terrain is
easy and in the old days would be a 1 star, but I wouldn't
recommend it for a wheelchair. &lt;br /&gt;

Naturally, I tried to make this puzzle harder than it is.  Recently, another finder reminded me of something I know about the CO, but hadn't considered, for some reason.  I guess because I was making this one so hard.  Once I backed off and started again, I found what I needed.
Finding the cache itself was tough.  It really kind of disappears until you see it.  Nice cache.  I think today was my first visit to this particular trail.

Was given a hint on this cache as a Christmas present. I tried that already, I complained. But, when I had tried it, I was messing it up, making it more complicated than it is. Finally decided I'd better get out here while it's still dry. Couldn't find the cache. After 25 minutes, I sent out a distress message, but while waiting for a reply, I finally spotted it by using techniques mentioned by previous finders in the logs. Took a snake, left some kind of anime space character.

The only thing that came to mind seemed to obvious so I kept looking for other solutions.  Finally, one day, I was speaking to a fellow cacher and, comparing thoughts, we both had the same idea which turned out to be correct.  

I took Rocky, the shelter dog, out with me to search for this one today.  We reached GZ and saw the many geotrails without a clue as to which would be right.  I chose one and stopped when I felt blocked, chose another one and ran into a dead end.  After several more tries, I went back to the first path I tried and went a bit further this time.  Just as I was about to despair and give up, I looked down and there the cache was, right at might feet.  The camo blended in so well that I couldn't see it until I was right on it. Was relieved to finally get the smiley and get this one off my closest list.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">As of now, I hate traveling long distances. I used to love all that
travel. You know: airports, planes, rental cars, hotels,
restaurants, etc ... , but not anymore. Now I want to stay local,
maybe once in a while to another state, but never international
anymore. Here's why. Remember that commercial about the guy who
saved his company a bunch of money by switching to another phone
company? Well, I am that guy. Or I was. Because I saved that
company an average of 122,066.45 dollars per year, I was on a track
to be promoted over my boss. And he didn't like that. So before it
was promotion time, he planned 2 separate trips for me, going
North, South, East and West, to all these impossible to reach,
dangerous and exotic places, thousands of kilometers apart, all
over the world. What I was doing there was not important. He just
wanted me to be there to meet with some prospects. But I figured
that was just a trick to keep me out of the office, out of sight of
the big boss, and in the middle of places I could get in trouble.
See for yourself. 
&lt;p&gt;The first trip, he sent me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first to Madrid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then to Cairo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then to Vientiane&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then to Brussels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then to Moscow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and finally to Dubrovnik&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
The second trip, he sent me: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first to Bucharest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then to Cairo (again!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then to Baku&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then to Rabat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then to Astana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and finally to Vaduz&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Can you imagine? This was driving me nuts. And my wife too. She was
so worried that she wanted to check on me at every destination. So
she had to handle all these time zones, even date lines, and then
dial what looked like a million numbers to call me. We were both so
stressed out, that right in the middle of both trips, while I was
back home for just one day, we decided to hike out to place a
cache. We like that place, because it makes us dream to win the
Super Lotto! 
&lt;p&gt;After the 2 trips, I quit. That made my boss happy of course.
The only good news: I collected so many frequent flyer miles, I now
can go on vacation for free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I hope you'll enjoy finding our cache.&lt;/p&gt;

that's only an average of once per trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

Tried to brute force this over a year ago based on posted photos but was unsuccessful.  Every so often I would take a look at the puzzle, compile some information, but nothing clicked.  Finally I communicated with a little birdie from the North who tweeted that I had the required info plus much much more and chirped that I should concentrate on a particular word of the hint.  A little tinkering and voila.  Turned out we had checked that spot before but obviously not well enough.  Even today, it took a bit of concentrated poking about to make the find.

He mentioned that he hadn't been able to solve this puzzle and wondered if I had taken a look at it. I had, but hadn't done much work on it. He sent me his spreadsheet, and together we looked at the data, but got nowhere. One day I went to the area and tried to brute force the find - after all, I had read of many others doing it - but no luck, even though I did look just inches away from the actual hide. Last weekend I was nearby again, so I took another look, [b]again[/b] missing the cache by inches. After getting a little help from The North Star, x and I started staring at the data once more. He mentioned something in the cache description that he thought might be significant, but we didn't see how to use it. Finally, just before I was about to give up and put the puzzle away in defeat another time, I saw a way to use the data we had along with the idea x had, and coordinates soon followed.

After x's successful find this morning, I decided to visit this afternoon to see if I could find it too. At least, this time my search area was narrowed to one location! I looked again at places I had checked more than once before, and then (hooray!) looked in a spot I had overlooked before and found the container. It's good to have this one solved and found.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Finally I have extracted this long, sharp thorn from my side, but not without considerable assistance!
My story starts almost 2 years ago to when I first started geocaching.  At that time I was working in Palo Alto, and depending upon my mood I would either take I-280 or Foothill to work, but more times than not I'd take Foothill and make little detours here and there to grab caches. And since the posted coordinates of this cache were right along my path, I looked at this puzzle very early in my geocaching career.  I collected various pieces of data that I though would be relevant, and put them all in a nice spreadsheet.  But I wasn't able to make coordinates appear.  Frustrated with my lack of success, I saw from prior logs that other folks had brute-forced the final.  I reviewed the available information and was able to determine the general area of the final, and although I really wanted to find the cache by solving the puzzle, I still tried to brute-force it.  I failed.  In fact, during that first year I made three separate trips to the area around GZ, and on all three attempts my brute force attempts failed.  Meanwhile my spreadsheet collected more and more columns of numbers as I tried to find data points that would produce coordinates.
But then my company relocated to Santa Clara, and I stopped focusing on this puzzle.  Then recently I noticed that The North Star had solved the puzzle.  I dusted off my spreadsheet and sent it to him, and asked him if it contained the data I needed.  He assured me that I had all the data I needed (along with a lot of data I didn't need), so I continue to try to extract coordinates.  Since I was still hitting a brick wall, I asked Dotish if she had looked at the puzzle.  She hadn't, so I shared my spreadsheet with her, and she was just as stumped as I was.  Then recently The North Star let me know which data set I should focus on, and last night the light bulb finally came on for Dotish, and she shared the encoding method with me.  Of course the coordinates pointed to one of the places I had searched on all three of my previous brute-force attempts (and I know that Dotish had also made a couple of brute-force attempts on this in the interim).
This morning I returned with full knowledge that the cache had to be there, and after a very careful search I was [b]finally[/b] able to come up with the container.  What a sense of relief!
Due to the nature of the cache I TNLNSL.

My mom is an avid geocacher like I am, and she wanted to hide a cache. Given that she just comes along on the hunts with me, and I do all the internet stuff, we share an account, and I consider it mine. Nevertheless, I couldn't say no. Having a green bison tube, and an idea of the location along Adobe Creek near Edith that no one knows about, she set off.

We both like the idea of caches taking people to new places they haven't seen, and don't know exist. This is my first cache to portray that idea (though it's not my cache per-say.) Upon arrival, we started scouting.

First thing we saw was the strange creekbed. It was covered in some sand-colored tan substance, and upon further investigation, it was hairy, and easily removable, like dense spider web. We both wondered what it was, and to this day couldn't figure it out. But no time for that, we had a cache to hide.

We looked at the bench with the removable board, so that we could hide a cache inside it, and you'd have to take out the board to see it. (My idea.) We looked down in the creekbed, and under above-ground tree roots, making it hard to get to when the creek was flowing. (My idea.) We looked in several idealistic places to hide this green bison tube, but a central idea that we lacked was...being lacked.

"These structures are too far away from each other! Think of 'Craterellus' or 'Bouncy Coords.' Caches need to have a lot of places they can be or else they are too easy to find. If coordinates take you to a lone bench or a lone tree, the cacher will check only the bench and the tree! That make it another light post cache." She agreed.

Therefore, the scouting continued. We got to a patch of underbrush (as she called it) and she said "Well, that looks cool. Imagine if we put it in there." OK maybe I said it... Anyway, before I knew it I was off to stick this cache in there. I was in the brush for an hour:

Because thick brush is hard to get through without breaking branches,
Because I was trying out cache locations, and in many cases, I was afraid of the cache being washed away by the rain,
Because opening a key ring around a branch takes a long time,
Just because.

E're way, the cache was hidden. Though, I wouldn't say it like that. I'd say the cache was placed. I can't even call it a hide. It's just out in the open. But then again, this isn't my cache, it's her's. 

One thing in particular I don't care for about this cache, is that it is a micro. In a beautifully giant bush as vast as this, the micro could be anywhere, and who wants to search like that? Though I do believe that finding a cache is more fun after you searched for it for a long time, I don't believe that a hide where it's a bit randomly placed is that great. I would have placed something at least as big as an Altoids can. But no, this is a bison tube.

While in the brush, opening the key ring with a jack I made from a piece of metal, I pondered about the creek. I had asked about what was at the bottom of the creek-bed. It looks like sand, but when you pick it up, it's the consistency of cotton candy. I have yet to figure out whether or not it's a kind of moss, or algae, or plant runoff, or something else that sounds scientific. Whatever it was, it was some kind of geological feature.

"Geological feature! Could I make this an Earthcache?" Quick answer, no. At the time I was naïve and unaware of the responsibility of an Earthcache, and also that there had to be geological or historical data at the site in question.

So this isn't an Earthcache. This is not some amazing cache you have to solve a maze to get to. It's not an amazing hide (but trust me, I have some evil ones in mind for the future...) but it will take you to a lovely new place, this path along Edith. It will be a high quality container. It might not be your favorite cache, but it will be a +1 Traditional for you when you find it. 

Now to the meat of the description:

Do not remove the cache from it's spot, just open it, and sign the log.

Break as few branches as you can while getting to the cache. If there are no branches to avoid for future finders, this cache is just another "Oh there it is yay let's go."

There are many ways to approach looking for this cache. It's a green bison tube on a key ring, and the key ring is attached to the branch. The hard find is for that you'll actually feel like you've accomplished something when you find it. 

When approaching it, just know that it is near the ground, and more or less in the middle of the bush, closer to the NW side. Besides that, use your creativity. Don't resort to "If I burn everything, all that will be left is the cache!" Or anything like that. :)

BREAK AS FEW BRANCHES AS YOU CAN! I already said that, but I feel it is important. The bush has as much right to live as anyone. 

Enjoy the spot. Enjoy the creek, and if it's dry, enjoy that weird sand moss hair plant thing. Enjoy the water fountain in the form of a rock, and the trees that distort your GPS readings. And enjoy life and enjoy geocaching.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;It's time for our second safety themed geocache series. This
time around the theme is Hand Safety! We can't reach our goal of
ZERO injuries until we eliminate ALL hand injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical cache is a tupperware container located adjacent to
the Sunnyvale Water Treatment ponds. Please keep in mind that there
is a healthy gopher snake population in the area, and at times the
bugs are thicker than the stench in the air. Safety glasses are not
an uncommon sight on these trails.&lt;/p&gt;
The Hand Safety cache series was placed with your safety in mind.
Before you take a step off the trail to make the grab, look to the
west where you'll see the spectacular facilities that make up the
Beyond Safety workplace at NASA Ames Research Center. You'll only
need to take one step off the trail for this grab. The cache is a
tupperware container with plenty of room for tradeables. Please
check carefully for any of the local wildlife that may also enjoy
this hiding place.
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this cache is to recommend that you establish a 100%
Glove Policy like the policy in place in the Beyond Safety
workplace at Ames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of injury prevention is moving forward at an
exponential rate. In the Beyond Safety workplace we know that
wearing the APPROPRIATE hand protection can eliminate or minimize a
hand injury when a hand is exposed to a hazard. If we intend to
eliminate hand injuries, we&amp;rsquo;ll have to plan our work so that
gloves are the LAST LINE of defense. We'll also need to follow a
100% Glove Policy that requires us to not only use gloves for all
tasks that require gloves, but that we wear gloves that are
appropriate for the task. Below is the 100% Glove Policy in place
in the Beyond Safety workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Beyond Safety Workplace, our Glove Policy is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;100% of the time that we are engaged in&lt;br /&gt;
working with our hands or working on a&lt;br /&gt;
field work site, we will wear gloves that&lt;br /&gt;
are appropriate to the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some possible exceptions,&lt;br /&gt;
such as lunchrooms, restrooms, or inside&lt;br /&gt;
an office; any other exceptions should be&lt;br /&gt;
thoughtful and not made casually.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

02/24/2012 Cache Update: Many thanks to camnpete for letting me know that there might be something wrong with the cache. It seems that the whole GZ had disappeared!!! Replaced the cache and updated the hint this evening. Hopefully, this one won't run away too!!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After "correctly" guessing the hide, (we spotted it from across the street) and searching thoroughly, we discovered that our GPS receiver put the lie to our guess: Or did it?  We traveled to ground zero only 220 feet awaY and found "another hide" exactly as originally guessed except this one actually held the cache.  Talk about unlikely!  TFTC!!  TNLNSL.

the final cache location.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The above coordinates will get you to the
parking lot. The complete coordinates can be determined from the
puzzle below.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This park is tucked away in the foothills between Los Altos and
Los Altos Hills. There is a small creek flowing through the area
that kids and adults can play around in. There are picnic tables,
BBQ's and play structures for everyone to enjoy. I hate putting
caches so close to others, but this park is too nice to miss.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=
'http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_evil.gif'
border="0" align="middle" /&gt;This cache is rated a 3 because one of
the plaques, while in plain sight can be very easily missed and the
final hiding spot of the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr width="75%" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What is the year listed for the Freedom Tree? &lt;b&gt;A B C D&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Find the year listed at the Patriot Corner. &lt;b&gt;E F G H&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the Co-founders for the large statue in the park has a first
name of Joseph, how many letters are in his last name?
&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is a plaque that lists six famous battles, Valley Forge,
Gettysburg, Pearl Harbor, Guadalcanal, Corregidor and ___________
?&lt;br /&gt;
How many letters are in the missing battle? &lt;b&gt;J&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now using simple addition and subtraction solve each of the
equations to get the final coordinates. The final cache location is
located within the Shoup Park boundaries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;37 (B-C) (E+F) . (D+H) (I+E) (B-A)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;122 (C-I) (G+I) . (F+A) (I-E) (J+E)&lt;/h2&gt;

I told him I was doing a project about the park for school [:D] . Then I realized there was a hint from the Freedom Tree, and concentrated my search. I expected this kind of plaque placement, but I was still surprised when I finally found it because of all the trees in the park this one does NOT evoke freedom [:(!] .

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The CDC 7600 was the successor to the CDC 6600. It was roughly 10
times as fast as the 6600. The introduction of an instruction
pipeline helped solve the problem of the 6600's functional units
sitting idle unless the code was carefully scheduled to achieve
overlap. Physically, the machine was in a horseshoe shape to allow
for eacy access to the insides and the outsides while keeping
distances short for speed. The wood paneling and blue glass provide
a designer's touch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/f8f183c2-d92c-41b7-be88-b43666fa6190.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details on the CDC 7600 can be found at &lt;a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_7600"&gt;CDC 7600&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary software development facility in those days was at
215 Moffett Park Drive (See CDC 6600 cache for picture). Times were
good and CDC overflowed available space so the building at 155
Moffett Park Drive (aka the Prudential Building) was leased for
extra space. That building complex included a cafe in the round
building in the middle of the complex. I recall getting lunch from
that cafe and eating it on the deck. Today, the cafe is gone and
the building sits empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a bison tube and it is not in the landscaping so be
kind to plants. At least one adjacent building appears to have a
tenant. You might have curious eyes during the work week but I
can't say for sure since I've only visited the area on weekends
when things are deserted&lt;/p&gt;

1/25/2011: Please put back exactly where you found it otherwise it can easily get lost.  If you can't find it, email me a photo of where you think it should be and if I confirm you are correct, you can claim the find.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Cache is not at the posted coordinates but is within a half mile.  For this puzzle cache, you will have to solve a few puzzles to get to the real coordinates.

Puzzle 1- In this puzzle, each capital letter stands for a word. For example: The answer to 32 P on a C would be 32 Pieces on a Chessboard, and 21 D on a D is 21 Dots on a Die.
1.1- 1 H on a U
1.2- 2 P in a Q
1.3- 3 M of a T
1.4- 3 L in a HP
1.5- 4 A in a D of C
1.6- 4 C in a S
1.7- 5 L in a L
1.8- 6 S on a G
1.9- 6 N on a D
1.10- 12 V in a CB

Puzzle 2- This puzzle is an easy anagram. It will tell you what kind of cipher will be used in Puzzle 3. This cipher is listed on the American Cryptogram Association.

2.1: An anagram that tells what type of cipher to use: FAIRY LAP

Puzzle 3- The rules of this cipher are those from the American Cryptogram Association. The type of cipher is found by solving the anagram in Puzzle 2.1. 

Take the last word of each puzzle in Puzzle 1 (Puzzles 1.1-1.10). Line them up. For example, if your words were “Center,” “of,” “Many,” and “Limbs,” you would write “CenterOfManyLimbs.” Take the first two letters of each word and line them up. “CenterOfManyLimbs” would become CEOFMALI.  Delete any repeated letters. (If you ended up with something like CEOCFMAALI, delete the extra C and extra A to get CEOFMALI.) Write the rest of the letters in the alphabet (excluding j) not in the keyword after the keyword. CEOFMALI would become CEOFMALIBDGHKNPQRSTUVWXYZ. This is your new “keyword.” 

The cache is at N 37 AB.CDE, W 122 VW.XYZ
Follow the rules of the cipher found in Puzzle 2.1 to solve:

AB.CDE = NYCWI OVLIF QRPMU VUFGD KQIOH V
VW.XYZ = VMNSW FUVOC FOQYN YANNI OBQC

Checksum: A+B+C+D+E+V+W+X+Y+Z=34

Beware of muggles driving by, especially during rush hours. Part of the cache is visible, and you do not need to climb on anything to get it.  Best to park on nearby side street.  Probably easier to find when there is daylight.

Please be gentle to the hosting flora when putting the bison back.  Please tuck the ring-side in first.

Update: 6/25/08 Depending on where the bison is, it may be easier to tuck it back with the ring-side facing out.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Gjetost, as it is known in this country, is a brown Norwegian whey cheese. It's made by boiling a mixture of cow and goat milk, cream and whey carefully for several hours so that the water evaporates. The heat turns the milk sugar into caramel which gives the cheese its characteristic taste and color.

My wife is very partial to this cheese -- one of many.  To each their own.  And no, this is not part of a cheese series.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Sometimes when I'm trying to solve a problem, I just end up in a
state of confusion. Maybe some of you have also been in a similar
state at times. I sometimes think that I need to get better
organized; Maybe draw on the skills and talents of my neighbors
while sharing my skills and knowledge with them. You know, form a
sort of puzzle solver's union to assemble all of the great minds to
work together to solve difficult problems. But I suppose as the
group grew in population and geographical scope, it would end up
getting complicated too. We'd might do stuff like write a
constitution, elect representatives, levy dues and create laws to
preserve a sense of peace and order. In the end though I fear we'd
just end up confused and distracted by all the political stuff and
it would get in the way of the original goal: solving the problems.
But I digress. (See how easily I end up this confused state?)
Suffice it to say, at least this puzzle emerged as a result of my
most recent state of confusion. Can you make any sense of it?&lt;br&gt;

Since we had this puzzle run planned I decided to take another look to see what else might be along the way and revisited this one.   This time I saw the obvious and had the coords pretty quickly.  I forgot to write down the hide hint from the solution and was starting to regret it after 5 minutes of searching with no luck.  Fortunately I find it shortly thereafter.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Special Notes about the 2012 Puzzle Challenge:&lt;/b&gt; To be considered for Fastest Solver points, you must verify your solution with &lt;a href="http://certitude.comxa.com/certitude.php?wp=GC3MMPD"&gt;certitude&lt;/a&gt;. If you have worked as a team (or otherwise shared knowledge), please email me separately, so that points can be distributed correctly. All "point" scoring is arbitrary anyway, subject to change, at the discretion of the cache owner, and probably completely meaningless (unless you just want to be announced sooner at the celebration banquet). The real challenge is just to see whether you can solve all of these caches by the end of the year. To maintain fairness, hints should not be offered by the cache owner or other solvers until the fifteenth of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Special Notes about this month's puzzle:&lt;/b&gt; Submit solution coordinates in the form: N XX XX.XXX W XXX XX.XXX in order to receive the true coordinates for the log. One of the reviewers did not like the original location; so The North Star graciously found a new location for the cache.&lt;/p&gt;

There are some nice tracts of bike paths here and a park with tennis and basketball courts. </groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This was a regular cache, but it was plundered twice within a week at different locations, so it's now it's a micro and magnetic. Too many geomuggles around I guess.

The biggest challenge to this cache is finding a way in! For a greater challenge, try this one without a map.
&lt;P&gt;
For a nice, easy bike ride, start out at N37'23.891 W121'59.259 and take the entire length of the Greenbelt to the cache.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The cache is not at the posted coordinates, but is within an eighth of a mile of there. To get the true coordinates you must solve the easy puzzle below.

On one of my recent shopping excursions, I parked near the posted coordinates. After purchasing a couple of items at Michael's, I returned to my car. Next on my agenda was a long hike to place a new cache in my TC (Terrain Challenge) series. But I didn't have much energy. I wondered if it was due to lack of protein. Not too likely; lately, I have been frequenting Outback Steakhouse so much that I was now greeting people with "Goo day Mate". Iron poor blood? Hardly, with all the Geritol in my medicine cabinet. Then it dawned on me. Spinach. Yes, spinach. I haven't had any since a couple of  days ago. Luckily, there was no dearth of eating places in the strip mall. One in particular looked quite promising, but alas, the reality was different. Disappointed, I gave up the idea of placing a TC cache. But, there is a silver lining to every cloud. From my disappointing experience, came the idea to place this non-TC cache.

The cache coordinates are obtained by adding 0.0CA' to the latitude and subtracting 0.0BA' from the longitude.
A= Number of characters in the first word of the eatery's name
B= Number of times the letter o appears in the name of the eatery
C= B+ Number of times the letter p appears in the name of the eatery.

Checked out the published coordinates on Google Earth and found a restaurant. Used the name to quickly solve the puzzle and headed over to find the cache. Coordinates took me right to a likely spot, but no cache, only spider webs. Looked around in other likely spots nearby - nothing. Rechecked my math - o.k. Started rereading the description and locating landmarks mentioned. Noticed a sign, had to chuckle, now the title and quest in the description made sense. Did a quick recalculation and headed GZ which happens to be close to the incorrect one I originally tried. Walked right up to it and again had to laugh since it was the same type of cache I incorrectly identified earlier.

A trail of great hints from rachell slowly pointed the way to most of what needed to be done, and final guidance from kanchan led me to understand the few bits I was still missing. Suddenly, I was looking, I'd joined together all the breadcrumbs, and against all probability, there were coords! Super happy to have this one solved, and in retrospect, I can definitely appreciate its cleverness. Smiley, at last!</groundspeak:text>

This puzzle is already hard enough, so I’m not going to try [:)]. I’m glad that I stopped by on the weekend since the final location is probably a bit busier during the week.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Made the retrieval before work this morning. Lots of places to search that fit the hint but only a few that made sense. 

My approach made this a 5-star puzzle for me!

About a year ago, I was working on another GT puzzle when he suggested this one to me and gave me a hint. The hint made perfect sense but, when I applied it to the puzzle, I couldn't seem to come up with just the right solution set.  Pages and pages and pages (well, really just a lot of lines on an excel spreadsheet) were filled with digits, calculations, probabilities and tables yet I wasn't one step closer to figuring it out.  I spent a lot of time on the internet, researching, calculating, researching some more, re-calculating. Nothing. Then,recently, I saw GT at a Venona event and he gave me another clue that was supposed to be a spoiler. Not for me! Nothing spoiled there!  More and more pages of nonsense followed and I was still in the deep, dark pit of confusion. Kanchan gave me another hint and I was about to pursue it when I decided to take one more look at the cache page.

POP!WHAM!POW!The lights suddenly came on.[8D] I quickly followed through with the solution path that had popped up in front of my eyes.  As the coords began to appear, I did the happy dance! WooHooo!  I had wayyyyyyyyyy over thought (and researched) this one when the simple solution was there all along. This is brilliantly constructed. 5 numbers into 15.  And so easy that anyone (even me) could do it. No special tools or brainpower required. I will add to my favorites as soon as I find the cache.

(And now, after the fact, I understand the hints - all except for one, which I will be checking on soon as I understand it leads to another puzzle).

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">When I first saw this puzzle like a year ago, I could understand only the title and the first half of the hint (they are identical!), and then immediately got stuck. Being quite inspired by some of the recent solvers/finders this morning, I couldn't resist taking another look at it, and you know what, I immediately realized that I now know what the second half of the hint is talking about! [:)] Yes, that is something I learned in the last 6 months or so. So I decided to go ahead and look up some relevant activities, which I had not done before. I soon realized that I was actually solving another puzzle along the way (and it was solved [:)]). While I didn't have much problems hitting the relevant information in the activities, what I got was something I knew already. Yes, I was stuck again at the exact same step! [:(]

Since I happened to be helping sleuthers on another puzzle today, I asked him for a help, and he showed me another way of labeling my findings, which gave me a couple of good ideas which soon was confirmed by him. I thought something finally clicked, but I was still wrong. [;)] But when he showed me another something, YES! I finally started to see some significant digits. Yes, the puzzle was finally solved!

I still don't know how one could make a puzzle like this. I'm quite impressed. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Sunnyvale City Plaza a new public space built over a parking structure and across the street from the recently rebuilt Caltrain Station. It's the latest in a series of renovations to try to bring people back to downtown Sunnyvale. Apparently the naming process was arduous as the council tried to decide between names such as "Barnum &amp; Bailey Plaza," "Out to Lunch Plaza", "Whatawaste Plaza" and "It's 'Sunnyvale' not 'Sunny Dale,' Fool Plaza." They settled on "Plaza Del Sol". The city council also just approved a plan to demolish the Town Center mall (except for Macy's and Target) and reextend Murphy street with shops, restaurants, theaters and townhouses. You can read more about the plans at The Sunnyvale Sun.Be sure to check out the kinetic clock sculpture and giant fruit recognizing Sunnyvale's agricultural history.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;It's time for our second safety themed geocache series. This
time around the theme is Hand Safety! We can't reach our goal of
ZERO injuries until we eliminate ALL hand injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical cache is a 6" pill bottle at the Sunnyvale Water
Treatment ponds. Please keep in mind that there is a healthy gopher
snake population in the area, and at times the bugs are thicker
than the smell. Safety glasses are not an uncommon sight on these
trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hand Safety cache series was placed with your safety in
mind. A few careful steps will have you safely grabbing this cache.
But take a peek before reaching inside and take your hand safety
into consideration. You’ll know that you’re close to
the cache when you look to your left and see a concrete slab with 4
rigging connection points. At one time someone was required to
safely rig and lift this piece of concrete. I wonder what methods
they used to protect their hands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this cache is to familiarize you with methods of
hand protection while rigging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to prevent hand injuries, we first have to consider the
hazards associated with rigging. The fact that we’re rigging,
indicates that we’re getting ready to lift or move something.
So we know that we’re dealing with some type of lifting
device (i.e. crane, chainfall, etc.). When we lift objects into the
air we apply stress to the lifting device, the rigging, and the
object(s) being lifted. When lifting devices or rigging are in poor
condition, or overloaded, they may fail. These types of failures
can subject us to much more than a hand injury. So the first items
to add to our list of hand injury prevention methods during rigging
are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crane Inspections&lt;br /&gt;
Rigging Inspections&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know our equipment has been properly inspected we
have to make sure that we have a qualified/certified lift operator
to perform the evolution. An unqualified operator may subject you
to hand injuries (or more) during the rigging process. In addition,
we’ll need a certified rigger to do the rigging. In the
Beyond Safety workplace it’s mandatory that we also use a tag
line during all lifts. A tag line is a line attached to the load
that allows a member of the lift team to help control the load
while it’s in the air without having to actually place their
hands on the load. So let’s add these items to our list of
hand injury prevention methods during rigging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certified Crane Operator&lt;br /&gt;
Certified Rigger&lt;br /&gt;
Tag Line&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we know that our lifting equipment is safe and that our
people are qualified to do the rigging and lifting. Our next step
is to make sure that we’re all wearing the appropriate
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), including the proper gloves.
In the Beyond Safety workplace we take into consideration the type
of rigging, amount of dexterity that’s required, conditions
(i.e. wet, cold, etc.). If you take a look at the EN 388 glove
performance level rating chart (see the gallery for pic), you may
settle on a glove with a minimum rating of 4343. Will it have the
necessary grip? Dexterity? Visibility? These are all decisions that
have to be made carefully. Without a proper selection of gloves to
choose from, our workers are forced to make poor glove decisions.
So let’s update our list of hand injury prevention methods
during rigging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proper Glove Selection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we prepare to lift, we have to make sure that we have a lift
plan, and that all team members understand the lift plan. The lift
plan should include items such as the weight of the load, rigging
equipment ratings, and rigging configuration. In our Beyond Safety
workplace we also utilize a tool called the “Safe Plan of
Action (aka SPA).” In the SPA we will identify the steps of
our lift, the hazards associated with our lift, and the actions
that we’ll take to eliminate the hazards. In our SPA we will
actually identify the specific type of gloves to be used during the
lift. You may utilize tools similar to the SPA in your workplace
such as the Job Hazard Analysis (JHA). So let’s update our
list of hand injury prevention methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lift Plan&lt;br /&gt;
Safe Plan of Action (JHA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to make sure our lift area is safe. Are
people clear of the area? Are the appropriate barricades in place?
Is ground in our lift path clear of items that can cause us to
slip, trip, or fall? Can all parties communicate properly (verbal,
radios, hand signals)? So let’s update our list one final
time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barricades in Place&lt;br /&gt;
Area Free of Slip, Trip, and Fall Hazards&lt;br /&gt;
Communication&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because you’ve taken the time to properly plan your task
that involved rigging, you have likely prevented a hand injury or
something much more serious. Let’s take a look at our final
list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crane Inspections&lt;br /&gt;
Rigging Inspections&lt;br /&gt;
Certified Crane Operator&lt;br /&gt;
Certified Rigger&lt;br /&gt;
Tag Line&lt;br /&gt;
Proper Glove Selection&lt;br /&gt;
Lift Plan&lt;br /&gt;
Safe Plan of Action (JHA&lt;br /&gt;
Barricades in Place&lt;br /&gt;
Area Free of Slip, Trip, and Fall Hazards&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This is an &lt;b&gt;indoor&lt;/b&gt; webcam cache.&lt;br&gt;
There is no physical cache container to find or logbook to
sign.&lt;br&gt;
What you do for this is go to the location and stand in view of the
camera, so a picture of you is broadcast on the Internet.&lt;br&gt;
Then get a friend to capture the picture to a file, and upload the
picture with your log to show you were there.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">I &lt;i&gt;love&lt;/i&gt; this place! Weird Stuff Warehouse has been in
business for quite a while in various locations around here. They
buy and resell all kinds of funky surplus electronic stuff. If
you're anything like me, budget an extra hour or so for looking
around after you get your picture taken. 
&lt;p&gt;Here's how people generally work webcams:&lt;br&gt;
The first thing to do is to team up with a friend who can be at a
computer looking at the Weird Stuff Warehouse web site at
   &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.weirdstuff.com" target=
   "_blank"&gt;http://www.weirdstuff.com&lt;/a&gt; in a browser.&lt;br&gt;
For the webcam image follow the link &lt;a target="_blank" href=
"http://www.weirdstuff.com/sunnyvale/html/weirdcam.htm"&gt;"WeirdCam -
Sunnyvale"&lt;/a&gt; near the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be easier if both of you take a look at the site and the
webcam page ahead of time to see what the area looks like where you
need to stand. The camera is always running, but when the location
is closed and the lights are off you won't see anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, go to the posted coordinates. They are about as close to
the camera itself as you can get and still have your GPS receiver
get a signal. The camera is right on the other side of the
wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now go inside. The web page lists the hours when the location is
open. Most recently the hours were 9:30am to 6:00pm Monday through
Saturday and 11:00am to 5:00pm Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stand where the camera gets a recognizable picture of you. It's
not far from the front door and the camera is not hard to see.&lt;br&gt;
You'll probably want to talk with your friend by phone to get
confirmation that they see you in the picture. The camera displays
a new image about once a minute so you may have to wait a bit for
your friend to tell you you're in the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some suggested guidelines for a picture that shows it's
a picture of you the geocacher, not just some random screen
shot:&lt;br&gt;
-Be in the foreground of the picture as in the sample pictures
below. You'll be too tiny to see well if you're much further
away.&lt;br&gt;
-Face the camera and look straight at it. That alone will
distinguish you from people who are just looking at all the
Stuff.&lt;br&gt;
-Make some distinctive gesture, which will most likely be holding a
cell phone to your ear as in the sample pictures. Or if you like
you could hold up your GPSr or wave to the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the web page is showing a good image of you, your friend
should save a copy of it. In most Windows web browsers, that's one
of the options from a right-click on the image. You may like to
practice this ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have your friend get the saved image file to you somehow, maybe
as an e-mail attachment. Log your cache visit, then upload the
image file as an addition to your log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, all the above are simply suggestions of likely ways to get
this to work. If you happen to have a web enabled PDA that you can
use to capture the webcam image by yourself without a friend's
help, or creative ideas about posing in a recognizable way, go for
it. Have fun. This is about having fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, when I went for the sample pictures on a Saturday
morning there were a number of people around me including the store
personnel and nobody paid a bit of attention to me posing and
talking, so feel free. In fact, they know about the cache and will
point out the cam if you ask. Nice folks.&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

It took us about 20 minutes just to find the camera, and then we had to wait to take a picture that was worthy of the cache.  We moved left, and we moved right, and eventually took a pretty good picture.  Thanks to nozynabor's ipad, for making the execution of this cache easier.  What a blast we had completing this one.  We laughed at our ineptness all the way back to Fremont!</groundspeak:text>

We looked at the walls for a camera, there there is weird stuff everywhere. We asked the counter guy where the cam was located and he did not know. Figured it out and got out pictures taken. My Android does not have screen shot, but took a picture with my Blackberry of the android screen. Thanks for the Too Weird Cam cache. Posting pictures of myself and Conehead51.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;/div&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;As a public service to our new
geocaching members, I'm providing some useful facts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;If you take something from
the cache, leave something of equal or greater value.&amp;nbsp; It's an
unspoken &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;rule&lt;/span&gt; that even I
adhere to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;&lt;span style=
"font-style: italic;"&gt;Puzzles&lt;/span&gt; are the fastest growing type
of cache in the Bay Area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;The &lt;span style=
"font-style: italic;"&gt;United States and Germany&lt;/span&gt; lead the
world in geocaching popularity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;You haven't officially
geocached until you've logged the experience on &lt;span style=
"font-style: italic;"&gt;www.geocaching.com&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;You haven't officially lived
until you've attended a &lt;span style=
"font-style: italic;"&gt;Mega-Event&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;Hard as it might be to
believe, there's more geocaching going on in &lt;span style=
"font-style: italic;"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/span&gt; than in San Jose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;As a minimum, a geocache
normally &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;contains a
logbook&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;There are still a few
&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Project A.P.E. Cache&lt;/span&gt;s in
existence today.&amp;nbsp; There were released when the movie Planet of
the Apes came out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;In &lt;span style=
"font-style: italic;"&gt;Florida&lt;/span&gt;, there have been over a dozen
cases of the remains of geocachers being found in the stomachs of
alligators and crocodiles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;&lt;span style=
"font-style: italic;"&gt;GPS Adventures Mazes&lt;/span&gt; are designed to
teach people of all ages about GPS technology and geocaching
through interactive science experiences.&amp;nbsp; There have been a
couple of cases where people have remained lost in these mazes for
over 24 hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;The &lt;span style=
"font-style: italic;"&gt;puzzle&lt;/span&gt; or mystery cache is indicated
with a question mark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;As one might guess, since the
Groundspeak offices are located there, &lt;span style=
"font-style: italic;"&gt;Seattle&lt;/span&gt; is a very active geocaching
area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Also rather surprised to see this one surviving given what is around it, or more specifically no longer around it.  Looking at all the nicely cut down grasses, we wonder if perhaps the grounds keepers have in fact discovered and helped preserve it.  Regardless, thanks for maintaining one of the originals.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">THE CACHE IS NOT AT THE POSTED COORDINATES, BUT IS WITHIN 3 MILES.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">To determine the cache coordinates, you must identify the titles of 13 movies from 13 lines of movie dialogue. 
The movies are from the years 1939 - 2002.
All of the movies are either listed on the American Film Institute's ranking of the "100 greatest movies" of all time or are winners of the Academy Award for "Best Motion Picture."

The movies associated with the first 5 lines of dialogue will be used to develop an alphabet key which will be used to calculate the cache coordinates.

Here are the lines of dialogue:

(1) "Did you bring your broom stick with you?"

(2) "She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother."

(3) "Round up the usual suspects."

(4) "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."

(5) "Life is like a box of chocolates."

Now, identify the 5 movies based on the preceeding lines of dialogue.

If the word "the" is the first word in any movie title, delete that word from the beginning of the title.

Develop an alphabet key by writing out all five movie titles in order one after the other. Delete all letters that repeat earlier letters and add any missing letters at the end of your sequence in the same order that they appear in the regular alphabet.

Next, assign the numbers 1 through 26 to all your letters from left to right. To verify that your alphabet is correct, use the numbers from your alphabet to value the phrase "Let's Go to the Movies." Each letter in that phrase will have a numerical value. Sum up all the values. If your total is 245, your alphabet is correct.

Now, identify the 8 movies referenced by the following 8 lines of movie dialogue:

(A) "As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again."

(B) "I was a better man with you as a woman than I ever was with a woman as a man. Know what I mean?"

(C) "He's fleeing the interview."

(D) "I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in."

(E) "Is this your first time?"

(F) "May the force be with you."

(G) "All that Jazz."

(H) "I knew a man who once said Death smiles at us all. All a man can do is smile back."

After you have identified the 8 movies, delete the first word of any movie title if that word is "The."

Using you alphabet key, assign the proper numerical value to each letter of the 8 movie titles and sum up those values for each of the 8 movies. 

A checksum for the total of all 8 movie values is 657.

To obtain the actual cache coordinates from the 8 numbers you have calculated, select one digit from each number (counting left to right) as follows:

(A) 1st digit
(B) 2nd digit
(C) 2nd digit
(D) 2nd digit
(E) 2nd digit
(F) 1st digit
(G) 1st digit
(H) 2nd digit

To obtain the actual cache coordinates, insert (A) through (H) into:   N37 2A.BCD   W122 0E.FGH

Good luck.

&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;"The best use of an acre of dirt in Sunnyvale."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This is how one resident described the Charles Street Community Gardens in Sunnyvale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little over 2 years ago, it was an empty dirt lot overgrown with weeds. On Memorial Day '06, Sunnyvale's first community garden was born. It contains 90 garden beds, 5 of which are part of the Food Forest where all produce goes to Sunnyvale Cares, a group that serves the needy. The Santa Clara County Master Gardeners have 2 demonstration plots at the garden; there's a Growing Circle for outdoor training sessions; and there's even a herb garden in the shape of a peace sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: The cache is *not* in the garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about the gardens, visit: www.sustainablecommunitygardens.org&lt;br /&gt;
Or read archive articles from the Sunnyvale Sun Newspaper at: www.communitynewspapers.com/archives/sunnyvalesun/20060913/cover1.shtml&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EXTRA CREDIT:&lt;/b&gt; For extra credit log your visit at &lt;b&gt;www.Waymarking.com&lt;/b&gt;. Waymark Code: &lt;b&gt;WM1J4B&lt;/b&gt;. Note: You must also post a photo of the gardens, in order to log your waymark visit, so bring your camera.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I noticed that this cache has been temporarily disabled for a period of time well in excess of "a few weeks" as contemplated by the cache guidelines published on Geocaching.com. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other caches from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever.

If you plan on repairing this cache in the near future, please log a note to the cache stating your plans (don't email me) so I don't archive the listing for non-communication.

Please repair/replace this cache as soon as convenient. If you have decided this cache's time has come to and end, please archive it (using the archive listing link in the upper right) so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and geocachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future.

This plant was made during a session of summer camp.  It is a Tupperware container filled with toys.  The children did their best to be as secretive as possible given the huge number of dog walkers and summer campers who were also enjoying this beautiful preserve.  The area we chose is as secluded as we could find.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Ever since we started caching, for some reason we always traded for the balls we found in caches. Since then it has become a tradition and now we seem to be up to our ears in balls!

Bouncing balls, antenna balls, baseballs, golf balls, puzzle balls, inflatable balls, balls that look like animals - you name it, we've got one.

One has only so much use for balls of various shapes and sizes, so we decided to create this cache to release some of them back into the wild.

Please only place balls in this cache. It's OK to take a ball and leave nothing.

The cache is a large ammo box and is in a place where we like to go walking sometimes. It has some nice views of the bay. Park at N37 25.146 W122 01.097 which makes for a very short walk uphill. Enjoy the view and try not to go too ballistic. :-)

WOW, a Boulter cache! Nice to see that name again!
Biking the Baylands today with CelticTrekker.
Found GZ and the cache easily enough.
Enjoyed the view from up here also.

Thanks for the hunt!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I figured if someone is going to make a TB/GC hotel and call it something with the word "bugs" in it, then there better be plenty of bugs all around! Depending on the season, and the weather, this place is absolutely dominated by Mosquito Hawks, Orb Weaving and Wolf Spiders about as big as your palm, enormous inch long black Eleodes Beetles which stand on their head when threatened, and don't forget the overwhelming amount of Mosquitoes and Midges. My good friend Moose and I have been walking out here almost everyday for the past 2 months, and the bugs are getting more and more overwhelming as the weather gets nicer! At least we have the cold winter to look forward to. 

So don't get the heeby jeebies and come on out for a nice walk or bike ride! You can pick up a lot of geocaches out here if you have the stamina for it. Maybe grab a long sleeve shirt.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This Redwood Preserve is one of those places in my own back yard that I would have never known about if a cache wasn't there. I noticed that the owner of GCG568 gave up on it, so I took the spot. I hope you like your discovery of this area as much as I did.

I approached this by parking near 482 University Ave and walking through the Redwood Grove to enjoy the scenery. There is a much closer park-and-grab, as well, close to the cache.

Note: The scenic University Avenue approach is not suitable for small children or when the trails are muddy. Look for an approach from the north if you want to avoid a short-but-steep dirt trail.</groundspeak:long_description>

Yes my friends, the dentist's office. It is home to many many things indeed. Home of those little maze toys, retainers, and pain. Home of memories, good and bad. Memories of gagging on x-ray film, and memories of "Shiny New Smiles."

I have many memories. Teeth cleanings all the way back to my childhood, (I rarely brushed.) Getting toys afterwards from the cabinet, (Recently I use them to stock geocaches.) Braces as a teen, mazes, fillings, find it books, teeth safety pamphlets, all memories with the dentist's office as a home.

Whatever your memory of your dentist, just know that this office, as with many others, is home to memories from many people. This office is home to memories, yes, but also a quaint little patch of flora in a corner of parking (and this patch might be home to some other more sought after things.)

This office is home to trees adorning the parking spaces, many other types of plants which could provide cover for another thing this office is home to, a geocache.

When I hide geocaches, I always think, what would a geocacher enjoy finding, and what journey would a geocacher enjoy having?

Bring tweezers. (and a pen.) This is the first of the two "Equilateral" caches.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;big&gt;One might ask if this sentence contains a three and yes it
does, most certainly.&amp;nbsp; Of this I can assure, an amateur can
solve this puzzle, and even their grandmother.&amp;nbsp; However, my
puzzles are said to be a bit baffling and maybe so; I just try and
make them challenging.&amp;nbsp; So who can you believe?&amp;nbsp; My
advice is to develop your own criteria and forget all the
hysteria.&amp;nbsp; Or even better yet, disregard the puzzle&amp;rsquo;s
rating for goodness sake; you don't need to fret.&amp;nbsp; While good
advice, ignoring the rating is something I probably have done just
twice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s a little too coincidental that I came close to choosing
"Coincidental" as this puzzle&amp;rsquo;s title.&amp;nbsp; The obvious
method of hiding the latitude digits is no longer being used for
longitude.&amp;nbsp; The method I am using is clearly a variation of
what was used for the latitude.&amp;nbsp; Here's an explicit clue: this
sentence yields a zero.&amp;nbsp; You'll need basic math; something
that is very simplistic.&amp;nbsp; Please don't give up, but retain a
positive perspective.&amp;nbsp; This last sentence and piece of the
puzzle is just that, and nothing more is required.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is in memory to our mom Ramona.  We tried our best to find a spot on Ramona Street to recognize her and this was the best I could do.  I know everyone hates ivy hides, so this is in as little or no ivy as possible - just look for the signs and you will find the cache.  

It is in a camo dressing - please re-wrap it after you find it.  Inside the camo is a pink container with many pink items, pink ribbons, a trackable, some coins, and other goodies inside.  The color is special for our mom's cache.  For the first few there are a couple plush pink items connected to the outside of the container - they are to be taken.  After the second one is gone, please also take the plastic baggie with you that is covering the cache as it is no longer needed.

Details:  WE KNOW - IT IS NOT A GREAT SPOT BUT WE WANTED THIS ON RAMONA STREET AND IT WAS REALLY THIS OR NOTHING.  WE SUGGEST THAT WHEN YOU FIND THE CACHE TAKE IT TO YOUR CAR OR WALK UP THE BLOCK WITH IT TO DO THE ITEM EXCHANGE AND LOG SIGNING AND THEN RETURN IT.  THERE ARE MUGGLE HOUSES ON EITHER SIDE (ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT ON RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY) AND TO THE WEST HOUSE YOU WILL BE IN PLAIN VIEW UNLESS YOU PARK YOUR CAR CORRECTLY.  EXTREME STEALTH IS NECESSARY.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;b&gt;Update: May 2, 2010&lt;/b&gt; Today we received an email from Shroomie
letting us know that one of his friends came to visit him today and
told him that his dog came home with a geocache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fortunately, when the friend described the cache, Shroomie had an
idea it was our cache - as the friend lives near Bol Park and
Shroomie had found one there as described. We immediately called
Shroomie's friends, picked up the cache and placed it back in its
location.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Congrats to Shroomie for finding this cache twice!&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;The cache is not at the posted
coordinates.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
Our story takes place in the distant future; the year is
2120.&amp;nbsp; An extraterrestrial race has come to earth in thousands
of ships.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; They arrived six years ago and quickly
established that their intentions were mainly benevolent.&amp;nbsp;
They had remotely monitored earth for literally hundreds of years
through the reception of our telecommunications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To make a long story short&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; They&amp;rsquo;re
advanced&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; They need specific plant and animal
samples&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; In exchange they will teach&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp;
They enter agreements with all major world
governments&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; The agreements establish specific
projects&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The company you work for has won a government contract to manage
Project V. The project is one of many agreements where the Visitors
have agreed to provide special training in the application of
specific key advanced technologies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Project V was
designed to train us in the practical application of Cold
Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the technical papers that the Visitors provided during the
contract negotiations they claimed that the odds against repeating
Fleischmann and Pons&amp;rsquo; experiment were a billion to one using
our existing technologies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; They also claimed that the
secret to extracting meaningful amounts of energy is in the precise
control of system temperature, pressure, and the surrounding
gravitational field.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the first exchange session, which was held at one of the
lecture halls at the New Stanford University, the visiting
instructor started his talk as follows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;I have reviewed all of your
resumes and although you&amp;rsquo;ve all completed advanced degrees in
science and engineering I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that this group is far
too large.&amp;nbsp; As such I have prepared an additional examination
for you to complete today.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I've designed this
examination so that for about three quarters of you this will be
the last session you'll attend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=
"font-style: italic;" /&gt;
&lt;br style="font-style: italic;" /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Now please open the sealed
envelopes that were provided to you at the start of this
session.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You&amp;rsquo;ll need to complete the examination
within the next 40 minutes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; No, I will not answer any
of your questions other than to say that these are simple math
problems.&amp;nbsp; Of course, for the purpose of this examination I
have not translated the notation into what you&amp;rsquo;re used to
seeing, rather I&amp;rsquo;ve used the same notation that I learned as
a student.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-style: italic;" /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You open your envelope to discover a single sheet with the
following lines.&amp;nbsp; Luckily you took the time to read about some
of the famous &lt;a href=
"http://cachbefound.net/geo/Alert_GC23V18.html"&gt;mathematicians&lt;/a&gt;
from the Visitor&amp;rsquo;s world and you immediately recognize the
notation being used.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Forty-two minutes has
elapsed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Those of you who have not turned in a
completed examination form will not be allowed to attend any future
sessions. This also applies to those of you who turned in
examination forms with errors; your identification tags will be
disabled.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-style: italic;" /&gt;
&lt;br style="font-style: italic;" /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;For those of you who will be
returning, we&amp;rsquo;ll continue this session at 10:00
AM.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If your identification tag no longer works it
means you failed the examination.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Our first topic of
discussion will be the application of advanced circuit design
techniques to achieve highly stable control system
architectures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Several months later I finally decided to get it out of the way.  I just treated it like a cipher and forced out a solution.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Several more months pass by before I found an opportunity to swing by here to make a grab.  I had to be careful extracting the cache for fear that I might need an advanced antidote from the outcome of this project.   I also think it might take until these aliens arrive to fill the existing log sheets with signatures!   Thanks for another one, CBF!</groundspeak:text>

The operators do not form a field; thus, it is not possible that the aliens could choose them as basic math operations!  Yeah, I know I am being picky, but this fact made the solution harder for me because I kind of expected it.  Ah, well.  Anyway, we stopped by today and found the final!  The puzzle was certainly interesting!</groundspeak:text>

Nothing against the CO, but happy to not have to return here!  Took a while to find this one, partly because we spent time unnecessarily digging about in unsavory areas.  Actually spotted the hide spot as we arrived, but dismissed it.  Just before we were to give up, I returned to the starting point, checked more carefully, and found the cache in what is really a rather reasonable hide spot.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Detective Brad Dough had been gathering info on the elusive
'Sunnyvale Doughboys' for months. The Doughboys were suspected of
laundering cash because their intercepted communications often made
reference to moving various types of 'bread' products or processing
large quantities of 'dough.' One day the detective intercepted an
especially tasty communique. It seemed that the boss, known only as
'Le Boulanger,' was planning to retire. As was typical in the
business, the boss expected to receive final 'honorarium' payments
from his gang of underlings (collectively known as the 'Rotten 18')
to fund that retirement. The gang members had received
instructions, with an embedded &lt;b&gt;cryptarithm&lt;/b&gt;, stating that the
payment was due and how much payment was expected. This was the
communique:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;font color="blue"&gt;Listen upa youse guys, and keepya muffins shut:
I'ma 59 now. I beena raisin bread long enough. For a while da
bizness was ona roll, but I'ma leavening. I'ma gonna baguette, cuz
I'ma tired of seein youse nutcakes sittin onya buns and loafing
around all day. To me dis business hasa dried up - likea desert -
cuz of all the sandwhichis here. Now it'sa time for youse to show
me respect cuza youse know it wasa me dat kept youse bread buttered
alla dis time. Here's hows it'sa gonna work. It'sa simple: &lt;b&gt;yu +
(pays * me) = bread&lt;/b&gt;. Remember, &lt;b&gt;me &amp;gt; yu&lt;/b&gt; cuz I'ma da
boss. And &lt;b&gt;bread * 4 * me &amp;gt; 18,000,000&lt;/b&gt;, a nice even number
for youse guys to work out between allaya. If youse guys don't
cough upa da dough I'll have youse all floured, kneaded, and baked
at 350 degrees in da oven. Den I'sa gonna giva youse necks a dutch
crunch. So youse can either rise up to dis occasion, or yousa gonna
be toast - all rotten 18 of youse. And donut try to double
croissant me, youse croutons. Gather upa youse shares odda bread
today. I tellya more tomorrow.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 The cryptarithm was easy enough to solve, but the detective still
did not know where the payments would take place ...until the final
communique was intercepted the next day. It read:&lt;br&gt;

 Detective Dough went to the coordinates only to discover that the
'Rotten 18' had already risen to the occasion and made their
escape. But he did apprehend the boss not far away, with the
biggest bag of bread he'd ever seen.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;i&gt;Note 5/11/04: I was politely informed that I have commited a
convention faux-pas in the cryptarithm. I can't fix it now without
totally fouling up the puzzle, but the cryptarithm IS solvable with
about zero (see hint 3 if you choose) extra effort. As a penance, I
have added another clue which should help you overcome this
situation. Won't happen again, I swear. :-)&lt;br&gt;

I've worked on it for ever, and ever, and ever, and have notes all over the place, but only a few weeks ago did I make the last leap to figure out the answer. I was able to solve the cryptarithm by hand, and the cipher was one of the hardest I'd ever solved, when I managed to solve it about a year ago, right after I started caching.

Mmmmmm, bread, especially that of the liquid variety.  I've had 2/3 of this solved for the longest time but had never completed the job.  Today I happened to see it on the map so went back and read some logs which ultimately nudged me to a solution.  Very clever.  Really enjoyed the gangsta speak.

Luckily I didn't encounter the irate snails that terrorized the previous finder.  I did find a mellow slimy slacker individual of a similar species.

I wonder if it belongs to PG&amp;E or the Water District. I biked over here after checking out the new Stevens Creek Trail bridge. I was seeing where Stevens Creek went and where the trail could go. It looks like the creek is behind the backyards of homes. There are only a few possible access points. This is one of them. It won't be easy, but I hope they continue the trail along the creek. I don't remember what the previous cache here looked like. This one was hiding in plain sight and had me fooled for awhile until I looked more carefully. TNLNSL. TFTC.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Another in a series of hides that my Mom and I have planned to roll
out over the next 6 weeks before she goes back to work. This one is
a smallish round duct-taped container. 
&lt;p&gt;Mom and I have been trying to get out and about in places that
are close to home and allow us to take the stroller around to find
caches. (Apparently its hard to bend down and search for caches
while I'm in the front pack.) Sometimes finding caches requires Mom
to leave me just a little farther away than either her or I are
comfortable with. We've decided to place a series of caches that
are stroller-friendly (although some may not be cacher-friendly,
necessarily) and don't stray too far from the pavement (e.g. less
than 10 ft).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I went on a long hike through here with both Mom and
Dad. The trail is gravel mostly but it's still Ok. Not long after
we left some big fun art project they both started saying
"Pee-You!", and before I knew it they had me down at this spot
rooting around in my pants trying to figure out what smelled. I
tried telling them it wasn't me, but they wouldn't listen! Even
with all sorts of people walking by they changed my diaper right
out there in the open - no privacy at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, while they were putting stuff back Dad took some cache he
had and said there was no more room, so we left it. Something here
smells really really bad, so I have advice for all you
GeoCacher-people. Don't come out here with your Mom, or you could
find yourself flat on your back in a VERY embarassing
situation!&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;It's time for our second safety themed geocache series. This
time around the theme is Hand Safety! We can't reach our goal of
ZERO injuries until we eliminate ALL hand injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical cache is a tupperware container located adjacent to
the Sunnyvale Water Treatment ponds. Please keep in mind that there
is a healthy gopher snake population in the area, and at times the
bugs are thicker than the smell. Safety glasses are not an uncommon
sight on these trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hand Safety cache series was placed with your safety in
mind. Congratulations, you've made it to the far side of the water
treatment ponds, and if you walked, you're probably anxious to find
this cache and get moving back towards the parking lot. I can
almost hear you saying "Enough about Hand Safety!" This cache is
only a step or two off the main trail, but a little closer to the
water than the previous caches in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this cache is to provide awareness of the Line of
Fire Hazards that play a role in a large percentage of hand
injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are Line of Fire Hazards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- They happen when you place yourself, or any part of yourself
in a position where you are directly exposing yourself to a
hazard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you avoid Line of Fire Hazards?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Safe body positioning is a basic strategy for avoiding
accidents&lt;br /&gt;
- In order NOT to be in the line of fire or put somebody there, you
MUST be aware of the constantly changing work environment around
you. Check out the attached slide in the gallery related to Line of
Fire Hazards.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Morchella, the true morels, is a genus of edible mushrooms. These
distinctive mushrooms appear honeycomb-like in that the upper
portion is composed of a network of ridges with pits between them.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/b51288e6-16a6-4e16-a184-8d6a58dbe1da.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are prized by gourmet cooks, and those who enjoy wild
mushrooms. Commercial value aside, morels are hunted by thousands
of people every year simply for their taste and the joy of the
hunt. Most often found in California in the Sierras after the snows
melt in the spring. Delicious, but not edible raw.&lt;/p&gt;

But several years ago, as other Town &amp; Country villages were upgraded, Sunnyvale's elected officials decided it was time to tear it down and replace it with a modern mall with all of the amenities.  The anchor stores, Macy's on one side and Target on the other have remained open while everything else nearby was leveled.  Fast forward several years and the new mall, labeled Sunnyvale Downtown, has yet to be finished.  Developers have come and gone as the economy shifted from good to bad.  Work on the mall stops for months at a time.  It's the joke of Sunnyvale.  Will it ever be completed?  If it is will it be profitable?</groundspeak:long_description>

the tone I used describing the delicious revenge I anticipated. So
I thought about it, and, filled with remorse, we decided to try to
make a fun puzzle instead.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">As noted in my 5/15/11 DNF log, I initially searched the wrong in-theme location because I stopped too soon [:(]. After jumping over this hurdle, I ran into a wall. I guess that I was running pretty fast since I’ve been seeing stars (or maybe that’s moons) ever since [:D]. While discussing another puzzle with the CO, this one came up in the “moon logic” conversation. The CO agreed that I had all the requisite information but I just wasn’t putting it together correctly. I told him “I did that” and his reply was “you’re doing it wrong”. I guess there is more than one way to skin a cat, but I didn’t consider this one. If there are clues, I obviously didn’t find them [:(].

I solved the puzzle a little over 2 months ago, but based on the previous DNF’s I was a little apprehensive on looking for it. I stopped by today on the way home from work. Thanks to the provided hide information, I found the cache the first place that I checked [:D]. Thanks for a very unique and challenging puzzle. TNLNSL TFTC #1087</groundspeak:text>

I am constantly amazed at the ingenuity of our dear fizzymagic, and I'm sure mcdurr had much to do with it as well. I had no trouble with the first part but didn't have an application to help with the second phase, although I understood what I needed there. The CO was kind enough to point out a link to a site that would handle that part. I still had some utility work to do to get the whole thing, but I figured out pretty fast what the system was, and sat in awe as the information leading to the coordinates appeared before my eyes. It was quick work at the cache site, but only because of the generous location hint and all the logs ahead of me. If I'd been FTF I probably would have been FTDNF.</groundspeak:text>

I didn't have enough time to examine this one in detail when it came out, so I shelved it until I was at home recuperating. Listened to it, immediately noted what's unusual about it, and got the "stop too soon" coordinates. Figured that would not have merited 4 stars, thought about how I would have done it, tried that, and I'm pleasantly surprised to see mostly good output. Tweaked it a little, and there it is! I love it when that happens - all the more because it hardly ever happens [:)]

I was extremely fortunate, I managed to spot something just out of place at GZ. I waited a bit for there to be no pedestrains, then went for it. I don't think I've retrieved, signed, and returned a cache so fast in a long time now [:)]

I don't really think fizzy is showing much remorse here, but that's OK, we got a fun and nicely crafted puzzle out of it [:)] Thanks for another good one!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This is a simple multi-cache intended to bring you to a local park to meet Perry and Miner, two Jerusalem
donkeys who live in a local park.  

The cache is well hidden, and only a little more than 400 feet from the donkeys.  Most of the difficulty is for finding the cache.

The entire multi is kid-friendly and dog-friendly.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Visit Perry and Miner (http://rosettastoneinc.com/california/donkeys/index.html) at the posted coordinates.  Perry is a miniature donkey and Miner is full-size.  There have been donkeys here entertaining youngsters in Palo Alto since 1936.

The Donkeys are walked through nearby Cornelius Bol Park every Sunday morning from 9:30 to 10:30, and they like attention.  This should be a good treat for younger geocachers.

When the animators at Pacific Data Images started doing their research for the donkey that would be voiced by Eddie Murphy in the movie "Shrek," they searched the net for a nearby donkey to digitize, and discovered that there were two practically in their back yard.  Thus, the donkey in the movie is modeled on Perry.

Here are the clues to find the cache once you've located the donkeys:

When standing at the gate of the donkey's compound, there's a concrete TV cable box projecting about 6 inches out of the ground.  A is two less than the number of letters in the oval on top.

There are a few "no trespassing" sign on the bridge and fences surrounding the creek.  Use the most common digit in the phone number as E.

Each side of the bridge has the same number of vertical posts, call it v.

B = v - 1

C is the number of donkey name tags hanging on the donkey gate.

When you are standing at the donkey gate, with the donkeys' name tags hanging in front of you, you will be able to see a little shed with a metal sign that says "Southern Pacific Lines".  On one of the corner posts of that shed, you should be able to read three numbers arranged vertically.  The top number is D, and the middle number is F.

   The cache is hidden at N37 24.ABC W122 08.DEF

The cache is an aluminum screw top cannister 4.5 inches in
diameter and 2.5 inches tall.

 Note:  Please be as stealthy as possible when searching for the cache.  It is near a bicycle/jogging trail and people can come upon you suddenly.  This cache has disappeared twice and it is unlikely someone just stumbled upon it.

Checksum: the 15 digits in the coordinates sum to 47.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">So many plot twists! I noticed something apparently important early on, but that didn't stop me from chasing other clues and stumbling into pitfalls. Just when I thought I was doomed, my geofriends threw me a line. Winterwolfe and The Red Rovers helped me refocus my attention, and I realized my way out had been there all along but seriously obscured. Then, it was mainly a matter of me finally not being so flighty, sitting down, and doing the work. For awhile, I thought I might need to get some glasses, but given the comparative ease with which I spotted the cache, perhaps I'll put that off a bit longer... [;)] TNLNSL, TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

Where to go from here? Then, a geobuddy advised that I change perspective.  After doing that, I got past step one and was again stumped.  Put it away for some time until last night when a conversation with another geobuddy gave me a big whopper of a hint as to how to proceed. Even then, I had a slight hitch as I didn't understand how one key piece of the solve worked.  Once that was cleared up, I was able to make Homer dance, Yay!  For me, the hints in the puzzle weren't of much help. I just didn't get them.[B)]

Was eager to make the grab this morning and add this to my 1-a-day.  Up to #310 now.  No problem with the find. It was in the first place I looked. Thanks so much for the puzzle.</groundspeak:text>

&lt;td align="left"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the third in a series of caches dedicated to the works
of Don Martin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great pleasures of growing up when I did was looking
forward to each new issue of Mad Magazine and all too few Don
Martin cartoons contained therin. The comic exaggerated faces,
slapstick, style of drawing, onomatopoetic sound effects and
everything about his cartoons, but mostly those great sound
effects! I was reminded of this panel by the booming of shotguns
during Duck Season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don had an impish habit of sneaking into the background of
photographs taken by tourists, leaving them to wonder who was this
smiling man in the background of their pictures. The caches in this
series will be similarly themed, as appearing the the vicinity of a
place, a business or something else related to the theme of the
image. Hope you enjoy them as much as I do placing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="left"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note: This micro is hidden in a high traffic area and
will require luck, patience and stealth to retrieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no hunting allowed here, there are areas nearby where
duck hunting is allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to leave your own favorite onomatopoetic sound effect
in your log entry. Also, please observe posted park hours.&lt;/p&gt;

there's a new cache to be found
with parking nearby that is free.

A few days after they left, they called to tell us that they accidentally left their film near the hotel where they stayed. Help us locate the lost film container by solving the puzzle they left us:

As soon as I sent an email to [url=http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?u=Chrysalides]Chrysalides[/url] on what I was thinking, the encode became apparent. It was only after completing the first part of the puzzle that I understood the clever title [:I]. I stopped by the final location on my way home from work, searched for about 5 minutes and in the process, found many places that the cache wasn't [:(]. I decrypted the hide hint and found the cache as advertised about 2 minutes later. Thanks for keeping this fun one alive.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">
</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The CDC 6600 was Seymour Cray's first supercomputer. It was the fastest computer in the world from 1964-1969. If you want to see one, just go up the road to the Computer History Museum. For lots more information on the CDC 6600, go to http://en.wikipedia.or/wiki/CDC_6600.
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of Silicon Valley (back when there were orchards and farming along 101), a Minnesota company named Control Data decided to build a new facility in Sunnyvale. The facility was intended as a manufacturing/assembly location for the CDC 6600 supercomputer. They also decided to move the software developers to this new facility from the previous location in Palo Alto. I was one of those developers and worked on the Fortran compiler for the CDC 6600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The 215 Moffett Park building was classic Minnesota, no windows at ground level (after all the snow would pile up against them). The second floor had tall narrow windows, I'm sure again a transplant of architecture from places that had -40 degree weather at times in the year. This picture shows the facility as it appeared around 1970. It's the big building toward the bottom right with all the cars parked next to it. The road in front is Highway 237 (known then as the Mountain View Alviso Highway). The large empty fields all around were used for onion farming as you could easily ascertain during harvest time. Other than Moffett Field and the Brass Rail across the highway, little else existed in the area. 215 Moffett Park drive was my workplace for a number of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/36d24762-8149-4c4f-b585-08299db3718f.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building today bears no resemblance to the old one. It was remodeled to add real windows. I'm not sure what they did to the interior but I'm sure it is much less warehouse-like than it was then. For a version of the aerial shot with labeled objects and a comparison with a modern day aerial shot of the same view, check out a friend's web page: &lt;a href="http://pages.sbcglobal.net/couperusj/215Moffett.html"&gt;Old vs New&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is down the road a short distance. I had a lovely hide near the building but it overlapped with two puzzle caches so I had play inverse Battleship and find a spot the puzzle cache finals were not near. The log is in a bison tube with no room for anything else. Bring your own pen to sign. Please try to restore the area as you found it for the enjoyment of those who come after. The area is much quieter on the weekends so better to come then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE:No need to tear up the landscaping when searching. Not hanging from landscape branches. In the fall and winter, Mother Nature's leaf bounty can cover over the camo. When replacing the bison tube in it's housing, put the metal ring facing upward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to oaknest for FTF&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Really had to work for this one, partly courtesy of my GPSr that "insisted" the cache should be about 15-20 feet from where it really was.  Searched very carefully per the cache info without results.  However, her GPSr finally decided we were in the wrong area (and mine finally kind of agree), so we refocused the search and soon spotted this very nicely camoed cache.  Happy to have this one in the smiley column.  At least the area was totally deserted on a Saturday afternoon, so no disruptions for the search.  Thanks for the challenge.</groundspeak:text>

This should be a good cache for beginners and for families. There

&lt;p&gt;Esther Clark Park is a small, undeveloped nature preserve of
grassland and oaks. It is open from 8:00 am to sunset. It has no
picnic tables, restrooms, or other amenities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preserve is named for Dr. Esther Clark, one of the founding
members of the Palo Alto Medical Clinic. A graduate of Stanford
University and Stanford Medical School, she was also the founder of
the Children's Council. Dr. Clark sold the land for Clark Park to
the city of Palo Alto, under condition that it be preserved as an
open space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial cache contents include a FTF prize designed for
hikers that contains insect repellent, Tecnu poison oak and ivy
lotion, StingEze, a tick remover and a first aid kit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Judge Roy Bean looked down upon Orfus Reed, the miserable wretch
before him, and began to pass sentence:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
"Neither the wails of your mother nor the pleas for mercy you mouth
will avail you," he declared solemnly. With Reed quaking quite
literally in his boots, Bean took a swig of whiskey and continued.
"It is said that with enough penance it is possible to find
redemption for your sins, perhaps even for a crime this heinous.
Such sentimental speculation is not worth a plug nickel, in my
opinion." His eyes ablaze, rotgut spilling from his glass, Bean
became more agitated. "As I weigh this offense against the words of
the statutes of Texas, I find that I cannot by law sentence you to
be hanged. I realize rogues like you deserve to die on the gallows,
but our legislature is not so enlightened. So that won't happen
today, at least."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
After yet another big gulp of liquor, the judge continued, "We
stand in judgment over you today because you stole a man's horse,
coat, and food and left him to die on the prairie on a cold
winter's night. No one would find out, you thought. It would have
been much worse for you today if he had perished - your neck would
be stretched by sundown, I assure you, and no lawbook could have
saved you. But he was a man of great stamina and resourcefulness;
he managed to cut wood from the brush with his buck knife and start
a fire. He nearly froze, roaming around the flatlands searching for
scrub brush for hours, but he lived to tell us who it was that left
him there. You thought that you could obtain mercy from us, your
neighbors, but if our sympathies lie with any man, it is with Bob
Carson, who almost died because of you." Reed began to shake and
sweat, wondering what Bean was driving at. "If our custom this time
of year is to give gifts, then I must follow it. It's Christmas Eve
now, so I have a little present for you," Bean guffawed. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
"I'm going to give you the same chance you gave Bob Carson. By the
power vested in me by the state of Texas, I hereby sentence you to
be taken out to the exact spot where you left your victim, where
you are to be left with no horse, no food, and no coat. Of course,
we can't let a felon have a deadly weapon, now can we, so no knife
and no matches for you." Bean drew the gavel down with the force of
a blacksmith's hammer. Reed screamed in terror as he was dragged
away, but it was in vain. He was never seen again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Within this sentence is a hint. 
[location hint: Hanging would be a fitting punishment for Reed.  Opposite the Triangle.]

Quickly understood the hint but didn't know what to do with it.  Tried a few different things but nothing panned out.  Finally, asked BearTerritory to confirm that I was on the right path.  She did and, as we were talking, it suddenly hit me - Duh!  I have even done one like this before. Very clever and humorous, too athough I wouldn't have wanted to come before the hanging judge.

Headed out after the rain to make the grab on this one.  Managed to get to the right place without any serious injury but then couldn't find the hint item or the cache.  Searched for a while and finally phoned a friend who showed me the error of my ways and led me to this beauty. 

Another great one adding to a week or so of fun and laughter.  Thanks Mr. Rat!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;It's time for our second safety themed geocache series This time
around the theme is Hand Safety! We can't reach our goal of ZERO
injuries until we eliminate ALL hand injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical cache is a small tupperware type container with
room for tradeable items located adjacent to the Sunnyvale Water
Treatment ponds. Please keep in mind that there is a healthy gopher
snake population in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this cache is to familiarize you with the glove
performance rating standard for Mechanical Hazards called EN
388.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might ask yourself why the EN standard? The answer is simply
that EN 388 offers more detailed performance level rating
information than the ANSI (U.S.) standard. In the Beyond Safety
workplace at NASA Ames Research Center we're encouraged to use
gloves with the EN rating system because it gives us the
information we need to make the appropriate glove selections for
our workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find this cache, you will have learned how to identify
the mechanical hazard performance levels of a pair of gloves
utilizing the 4-digit EN388 rating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you won't find the cache unless you do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Go to the listed coordinates and look through the fence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. You should see 4 numbers clearly posted. Write them down from
left to right. Imagine these 4 numbers are the 4 digit (abcd) EN388
Mechanical Hazards code used for a pair of gloves that you've
purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Digit = abrasion resistance&lt;br /&gt;
Second Digit = blade cut resistance&lt;br /&gt;
Third Digit = tear resistance&lt;br /&gt;
Fourth Digit = puncture resistance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Now that you've seen the 4 hidden digits through the fence,
you have enough information to answer the questions that will get
you the coordinates for the physical cache. But the link below will
give you a little more background on the components of the EN388
Performance Level Rating chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=
"http://www.tuckersafetyproducts.com/pdfs/Standards%20for%20gloves_EN%20388.pdf"&gt;
Mechanical Hazards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 1 (solves the first missing latitude digit): What is
the Abrasion Resistance performance level rating for this pair of
gloves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 2 (solves the second missing latitude digit): What is
the Puncture Resistance performance level rating for this pair of
gloves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question 3 (solves the missing longitude digit): What is the sum
of the Abrasion Resistance, Blade Cut Resistance, and Tear
Resistance for this pair of gloves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical cache coordinates:&lt;/p&gt;

We had both parked right across the road from this 1st stage but didn't grab it when we first arrived.
This was our last cache of the day. We should have done this one 1st as we had to go back out and retrace our tire trails.
The puzzle was easy enough to figure out. Found the 2nd stage with very little problems.
Nicely done!

As you approach Ground Zero, look up. This Sunnyvale landmark has
been in place since 1899 ; you can see a photo of the original
building (which I remember from 20 years ago) &lt;a href=
"http://historicimages.insunnyvale.org/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/sunnyvale&amp;amp;CISOPTR=428&amp;amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;amp;REC=2"&gt;
here&lt;/a&gt;. Look all around you; in 1899 this entire area was nothing
but orchards for miles on end. Not many people realize that long
before this was ever known as Silicon Valley this area was prime
agricultural territory, growing fruits ranging from plums and
apricots to peaches and cherries. To get an idea of what the valley
used to look like, here&amp;rsquo;s an old photo of the area from 1932.
Indeed, fruit production was so great here that Libby&amp;rsquo;s
opened up a fruit packing factory here in 1906; the Sky Can
(GCQNPV) cache is located at the site of the old Libby&amp;rsquo;s
factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Moffett Field was built nearby in 1931, and at least one &lt;a href=
"http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/XSB2D-1_crash_site.htm"&gt;XSB2D&lt;/a&gt;
aircraft crashed in the orchards not far from where you&amp;rsquo;re
standing now. Hanging in the Palo Alto Airport tower is another
photo of a P3 Orion that also crashed in this orchard; look to your
south, and the P3 came to a rest right where the Starbucks stands
now. During World War 2 the orchards were slowly cleared to build
factories and businesses to support high-tech industries. By the
mid-80s, the remaining trees had started to suffer from root rot,
old age, and blight and were steadily dying off. This mall was
built over one of the old orchards in the mid 90s but the water
tower was preserved and placed back on its original location from
1933. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to see one of the last remnants of the
orchards, head on over to Speed Ease (GCQNDQ) and look directly
across the street. Imagine the entire valley looking like this. Now
think about the microclimate effect of replacing all those trees
with rooves and pavement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Sunnyvale State University referenced on the tower does not
(and has never) actually existed; this was something of a standing
joke with the locals. It seems Charlie Olson liked to travel to see
the NCAA Final Four games. On one of his trips he found himself in
the elevator with the coach of the North Carolina State U team;
Charlie introduced himself as from Sunnyvale State U. For several
years afterwards Charlie used to get free tickets to the Final Four
until someone finally figured out that SSU doesn't exist!&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">1640: Well that was quite the adventure, I am sure the CO will be glad to not be bothered by my mystified questions. This morning I made a discovery and then confirmed it for sure while driving over here from Stanford to meet the gang. I actually found out for sure where I wouldn't be looking. As I was flying along to meet the gang I noticed something about my surrounding and predicted that that would be where the final would be.

So, after DNFing a cache somewhere else it was determined that this would be the next cache. We parked somewhere close, walked to the estimated cache location and found out it wasn't there. So we walked away from the car and down towards X+5 and soon had the cache in hand. 

An interesting puzzle that I am still not sure I have figured out completely, but we found it and that's what counts.

Cache only has log paper. Make a run or bike of it and  bring water and good hiking shoes on a warm day.  This loop trail is part of a larger 4.5 loop trail that I love to run on. Trails open here from 6:30am to 30 minutes after sunset.</groundspeak:long_description>

usually quiet, old business park in Silicon Valley. The Redwoods
here are nice, and it would be a shame to see them go if there were
to ever tear the business park out (given all the recent remodeling
of the streets of Sunnyvale and the Tasman Crossing area). Thanks
for visiting the cache, and the Woods, and as always sign the log

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I was listening to a history of video games on satellite radio on the way home from work. It included interviews with Nolan Bushnell, whose company, Atari, invented PONG.

The story included how the first coin-operated video game was placed in a Sunnyvale bar in 1972. It was so popular that the machine jammed-up with quarters on the first day.

Where was this bar, I thought? Being a history buff and a cacher, I had to find out. Perhaps someday a bronze plaque will be here instead of a nano cache!

Wikipedia story (but where is this bar today?) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong#The_first_successful_video_game

Detailed Pong story: http://www.pong-story.com/atpong1.htm

A little deep Googling reveals it is now Rooster T Feathers (right around the corner from the cache, between Goodyear and the paint store)!

small round black plastic container located at the center of the
circle on which the waypoints lie. In other words, it is at the one
point on the surface of the earth equidistant from all three
waypoints. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the theme. Please do not take anything, and leave only
small, round things (unless a travel bug shows up). Please do not
post any techniques or other hints when you log your find, even
encrypted. Leave it well-covered.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The puzzle for me was fairly easy, only because I brute forced most of it.  I did some guess-and-check on the rest of the puzzle by plotting all the possible coordinates on a map, and used some logic to eliminate the wrong locations.  I got the coords right on the second try.

The cache was also fairly easy, although I failed to comprehend the hint during most of my search.  After I understood the hint, the cache seemed very obvious to me.  Thanks for the unique cache thelins; I have never seen anything like it.  I was sort of expecting a stuffed animal sort of thing, but the cache was nothing like it.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">21:33 - this one really got me. Its original coordinates were at the parking lot of our motel, so it got my attention. I think I got the correct idea, but possibly couldn't draw the symbols correctly on my phone (even installed corresponding keyboard) to get any decent translation. So being a scientist, I came with the scientific method and got most of the numbers. Then came the problem with the remaining ones, but I narrowed it to a few possibles, placed them in the map and discarded some (like those in the middle of a highway). Picked the most probable one, found out how to correctly feed the data to centrifuge because it did not like the format and got it on the first try.

When we returned to the hotel, I had to go for a longer walk, since it is really "a couple of miles" away, not a couple of feet. Once I got to GZ, i misinterpreted the hint and started searching a dead grass under a ventilation grill directly under some camera. Then I tried some oher possibles before I got the idea. 

Left some Czech coins (10 with an artistic depiction of our second largest city - Brno + 1 Kc) in the cache as a souvenir.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I think I solved this shortly after it was published using a process of elimination method.   Today after a puzzle run with the CO I set off on my own to make a few more finds.  This was the first.  I decided to park and jay walk instead of waiting at the light to make a you turn.  As I scampered across the street I thought I heard a noise, oh well no bother.   After locating the cache I reached for my pen to discover it missing.   There it was in the 2nd lane right where it fell out of my pocket to make that noise I noticed.   I signed the log with my backup pen and then observed the minor miracle of my primary pen not becoming a pen pancacke complete with red ink blood.  When the traffic cleared I ran back across and using my long arm scooped up my favorite pen.   Thanks for the fun.</groundspeak:text>

I was a little surprised when I looked at the page just now before logging, as I recalled the puzzle being more difficult.  After reading the logs, I know why.

Today, we headed over to Mountain View because our Milpitas farmers' market was supposed to be closed (due to a wedding).  Afterwards, we took a little detour home to find this cache.  Cute container - I brought it over to the car to show Koi.  She liked the contents there - she may need to ask you where you got some of them.  Thanks for the puzzle.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">The cache is not at the listed location. To find it, you must use
either an Internet mapping tool or shoe leather to trace the path
of a by-gone railroad.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Once upon a time, two railroads ran through the Palo Alto area
called Barron Park, a steam line of the Southern Pacific, and the
electrified Peninsular Railway. Their traces can still be found
amidst the shops and high tech offices of the town. To find this
cache, you will follow their route with either high tech Internet
tools, or low tech footwear. 
&lt;p&gt;The nominal coordinates of the cache will bring you to the back
parking lot of a well-known local electronics emporium. Standing at
the coords, you would be on the right-of-way of the old Southern
Pacific. If you actually visit, look East at the roofline of that
establishment. If you've ever wondered abouts its architecture, or
the curious raised walkway on its current front side, it might help
to know that this complex was once the warehouses of the Sutter
Packing Company. In the 1920s and '30s it shipped strawberries
grown locally, mostly by Japanese tenant farmers, to customers
around the country by rail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href=

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image shown is an aerial shot of the start location - click
it to launch Google Maps centered at the start coords. Note that at
some point in the future the images won't match: The buildings to
the north across Park in this image, which disclose the old
railroad route by their angled sides, have recently fallen victim
to the dread &lt;i&gt;Developosaurus californica&lt;/i&gt; and passed from the
scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, on foot or with Google or your other favorite aerial
mapper, follow the old railway right-of-way to the South. You'll
find its route disclosed in the contours of property lines and
parking lots. You're heading towards Bol Park, near the spot marked
by &lt;a rel="nofollow" href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=ed4d17ea-43dd-4fdb-ba30-fd322ca615d9"&gt;
GC14TJB&lt;/a&gt;. That was also the location of the 'Neal' whistlestop
on the Southern Pacific and Peninsular railways. (From there the
tracks ran through what is now Bol Park, past Gunn High and
followed the route of today's Foothill Expressway, which was built
on the old right of way. Part of the SP route still exists, but it
now ends at the Kaiser quarry in Cupertino.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready to find the cache? One way or another, figure out where
the old right-of-way crosses El Camino Real, and go to that spot,
on the south side of the street. If you did it right, you will have
found a place where the right of way is still exposed as bare
earth, between two parking lots. Now you know why this odd vacant
strip is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you face the bald spot, look to the left and spy a busy
commercial establishment. Walk along the sidewalk towards that
business. In front of it you will see a number of containers, all
with similar purposes, and each with a title. Two of them have
titles with two words in common with the name of this cache. What
you seek is in the one further from you as you walk. Please be
stealthy - there can be a lot of foot traffic here at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spot also marks where the SP and Peninsular lines diverged.
The steam trains followed the route you traced to the north and
joined what are now the Caltrain tracks. From here, the
Peninsular's electric passenger line paralleled El Camino to
Mayfield and Stanford. The Peninsular line was abandoned in 1934,
and its right of way reverted to SP. The Southern Pacific called it
quits in 1964, and its track was removed sometime thereafter. The
Silicon Valley boom that followed replaced much of the routes with
asphalt. For a more complete history of these railways, see this

This was convenient as the cows could transport themselves. Of course, after walking hundreds of miles, those cows were pretty tough eating. At the posted coordinates, you will find a spot those cows would have found delightful. After resting and fatting up here, I'm sure they would have made much better eating. Alas, you won't find any cows here, or the cache. To find the cache, you will have to listen carefully for the sounds they make:&lt;br /&gt;

Not all renovation is progress.  

This cache was amazing and tricky and we definitely had to call in a life-line, but we learned a lot while solving it and loved the cleverness. Also liked the in-theme nature of the hide. Gets a favorite point from me. TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

     border="5" hspace="5" width="166" align="left"&gt; This 2-stage
     multi is the last (planned) cache of my "Been Here" series.
     &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
After 20 years of being employed by manufacturing sites, in
November 1999 I took a job with an Environmental, Health and Safety
consulting firm. For over 4 years I supported a wide range of the
company's clients in a variety of ways. Along the way I made a good
number of friends both within the company and at client sites. I
also gained a great deal of valuable experiences that I used to
increase the confidence within myself that helped me find another
job when it became time for me to finally move on. (Been Here:
Osgood)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I had a hard time finding a spot to hide a cache right near here
where I used to work, and I was finally inspired to make this a
2-stage multi-cache. The first stage is here where I worked, but
the second stage is not. I felt that this is fitting since I spent
far more time away from the main office at client sites than I ever
did at the office! &lt;img src=
'http://www.geocaching.com/images/icons/icon_smile_wink.gif'
     border="0" align="middle"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 The cache is about the size of a film can hidden in an area where
I often went for walks, runs and bicycle rides when I worked in the
Sunnyvale area.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Speaking of the "Been Here" series, the series includes the
following in autobiographical chronological order: 
&lt;p&gt;Been Here: Walsh&lt;br&gt;
Been Here: Elko and Reamwood (archived)&lt;br&gt;
Been Here: Patrick Henry&lt;br&gt;
Been Here: Pastoria&lt;br&gt;
Been Here: East Java&lt;br&gt;
Been Here: Osgood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Scotts Valley cache Benchmark Q 1455 is a related cache that
fits in between Walsh and Elko/Reamwood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Now for the instructions!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Stage One: go to the posted coordinates. You should be standing in
front of a "monument" that has identified 3 separate street
addresses for the 3 different portions of the building before you
to the northwest. (You are at the correct location if the name of
the middle company is a 4-letter acronym.) From left to right these
addresses are:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
PQR and STV East Java, and WXYZ Geneva.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 The cache is hidden at 37 2A.BCD North 12E FG.HJK West&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A = R + Y + Z &lt;br&gt;
B = V + X + Z &lt;br&gt;
C = P&lt;br&gt;
D = S&lt;br&gt;
E = W + Y&lt;br&gt;
F = V - Z&lt;br&gt;
G = Z - X&lt;br&gt;
H = P + Q - S&lt;br&gt;
J = S * V&lt;br&gt;
K = Y&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy! And happy caching!&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;It's time for our second safety themed geocache series. This
time around the theme is Hand Safety! We can't reach our goal of
ZERO injuries until we eliminate ALL hand injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical cache is a nano magnet located adjacent to the
Sunnyvale Water Treatment ponds. Please keep in mind that there is
a healthy gopher snake population in the area, and at times the
bugs are thicker than the smell. Safety glasses are not an uncommon
sight on these trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hand Safety cache series was placed with your safety in
mind. This cache is only a step or two off the main trail, but they
can be tricky steps. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to bring a pen for this
nano, as well as your attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this cache is to provide awareness of the role that
Inattention plays in almost every category of accident analysis,
which of course includes hand injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help avoid the pitfalls of inattention, there are some mental
checks that we can perform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Concentrate on ways to do your job better, or safer, or more
efficiently&lt;br /&gt;
- Always apply &amp;ldquo;what if..&amp;rdquo; thinking Ex: &amp;ldquo;what if
the knife slips&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
- Take micro-breaks by standing, flexing, or stretching to
stimulate the mind and body&lt;br /&gt;
- Pause and evaluate what has just occurred and review what is
about to happen&lt;br /&gt;
- Focus on hand and body positions&lt;br /&gt;
- Be aware of your surroundings&lt;br /&gt;
- Stay focused on the task at hand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that all these mental checks have in common is that
they require an individual to be PAYING ATTENTION in order to
remember to conduct the mental checks. This is the hazard when
employees are conducting hazardous work by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our Beyond Safety workplace at Ames we&amp;rsquo;re constantly
striving to find ways to combat inattention. Below are a few GROUP
methods that we use to combat the inattention of an individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working Alone Policy &amp;ndash; It should actually be called the
&amp;ldquo;Do Not Work Alone Policy,&amp;rdquo; but our employees never
work alone when completing dangerous work such as machine shop
work, confined space entry, energized electrical, working at
heights, etc. A key element of the Working Alone Policy is that
teammates need to be able to identify inattention in their
co-workers, and have the courage to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check-In Process &amp;ndash; This is a process that we use in group
settings such as meetings, or pre-evolution safety briefings. Each
member of the group is given a few moments to update the group on
their mental status (i.e. are they checked in?). An individual can
say &amp;ldquo;Pass&amp;rdquo; if they don&amp;rsquo;t want to participate, but
this happens rarely in our workplace where relationships are a
priority. Often times we end up learning that individuals are
battling serious issues at home that can lead to inattention in the
workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

Born in New York on March 27, 1866, Yuri Nahl was quick to become
popular. Yuris fame spread quickly and was soon the focus of much
attention. Because of this popularity, Yuri has been many places.
It seems that everywhere you go, someone will know Yuri. Yuri is
globally famous and is known world wide for endless relief

I originally hid a cache about 2 weeks ago. It was rejected and the reason given to me was that it was within 504 ft. of another cache. I went to the map and noticed there was 2 close by. Well, I went a retrieved my cache I had left and thought "this is too good of a place NOT to have a cache". So, I went back to the map and noticed a puzzle cache close by. I noticed the title and then it dawned on me about there I tried to hide my cache. I then looked at the hint (I am not good at math and don't care for it), and then began my search. I was like Indiana Jones...I just knew it had to be there. It took 5 trips and a combined 30 mins. and sticking my hand into areas that where scary, but I finally found it. This of all my 154 caches is the most rewarding.</groundspeak:text>

The location is pretty cool.  I never knew it was here.  Tried to read a few of the plaques but could only make out bits and pieces.  May have to go back, when I have more time, and take a closer look.

The hide was very simple but nicely concealed.  As WW says, the satellite photo takes you right to it but I still missed it on the first pass.</groundspeak:text>

01.447&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the posted coordinates, you will find a monument with two
plaques in front of an old building&lt;br /&gt;
A = number of words with the largest sized letters on the upper
plaque&lt;br /&gt;
B = on bottom plaque, last digit of year that the company was
purchased&lt;br /&gt;
C: Above the door of the building to the north of the coordinates
is a sign (often covered in ivy) that reads "Established 1856". Add
up the four digits in the year. C is the last digit of the sum.
Yes, this question is that easy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stage 2: This stage is only accessible from 6am to 9pm. N 37°
22.887 W 122° 01.619&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the coordinates you will be standing in front of an object with
a sign on your left and a sign on your right. These answers can be
found on those two signs.&lt;br /&gt;
D = last digit of the sum of the four digits of the year that the
Iron Man Museum purchased the object&lt;br /&gt;
E = x+0.5 where x is the number of ounces of gold recovered from 50
tons of ore-bearing rock&lt;br /&gt;
F = Last digit of the year "so recorded"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Checksum: Sum of A to F is twenty-nine&lt;br /&gt;

An in-theme object familiar to all geocachers. I sure wish I could
have hidden the final here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Final: N 37° 22.ABC W 122° 01.DEF&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is not in theme and is nothing special, so enjoy the other
stages, which are the main reasons for this cache. You can probably
find the answers for the final coordinates on the web, but what's
the point. It is not in the same park as Stage 2. It is NOT
accessible from Central Expressway.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I haven't toured the museum at Stage 1 yet. If you have, let us all
know about it in your log.&lt;br /&gt;

the company.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Update 12/29/09: A fellow cacher who's a direct descendant of the
founder provided some more information.&lt;br /&gt;
The museum at Stage 1 is open by appt. only - visit
http://ironmanmuseum.com/ for info and to schedule. The museum
covers the plant history from before the move to Sunnyvale up to
the present day. The plant is still very much in use, and is now
run by Northrop Grumman as their Marine Systems Division.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">A camo'd bison tube</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">To the crew of  Vitus Bering's ship St. Peter, shipwrecked off the coast of Kamchatka in early November 1741, the huge, easily-hunted sea cow was a godsend that helped most of them to survive and return home. Within 3 decades, though, their countrymen had hunted sea cows to extinction.

Steller's sea cows were the largest, and the only cold-water members of the scientific order Sirenia, to which manatees and dugongs also belong. Although they look rather like whales or sea lions, the order's closest relatives are elephants and hyrax. Feeding on sea grasses (in the case of the Steller's sea cow, primarily kelp), they are the only aquatic herbivorous mammals. Historically, about 1,500 - 2,000 members of the species known taxonomically as Hydrodamalis gigas ("giant sea calf") lived in the shallow waters off the coasts of Alaska and the Russian Far East, centred in the Commander Islands. Although they undoubtedly faced some hunting pressure from the Aleut and Eskimos, both of whom were expert whalers, their population was probably quite stable.

      Georg Wilhelm Steller, the naturalist and physician on Bering's expedition, recorded the first, and best, descriptions of the sea cow. They were up to 28 feet long, and weighed as much as 7-8 tons; drifting just below the surface, they were often mistaken for overturned boats. With a heavy bone stucture, they had huge midsections, a disproportionately small head, and a large, flat, twin-lobed tail. The wrinkly black hide was about an inch thick and very tough, covering a fat layer between 4 and 9 inches thick - the combination provided protection from the cold, pounding by surf, and rubbing against ice and rocks. It did not provide sufficient protection from Russian weapons, though - only one out of five sea cows hit by harpoon or rifle fire was retrieved, but the majority escaped only to die at sea from their injuries.

      Their external ear openings were only about the size of a pea, but the internal ear bones were very large, so excellent hearing can be assumed, although when they were feeding, they would completely ignore even a boat. Steller sometimes described the sea cow as if they were farm animals:

    These animals, like cattle, live in herds at sea, males and females going together and driving the young before them about the shore. They are occupied with nothing else but their food. The back and half the body are always seen out of the water.They eat in the same manner as the land animals, with a slow forward movement. They tear the seaweed from the rocks with the feet and chew it without cessation... During the eating they move the head and neck like an ox, and after the lapse of a few minutes they lift the head out of the water and draw fresh air with a rasping and snorting sound after the manner of horses. 

      During the ten months that Steller and the other survivors of Bering's crew spent on what would later be named Bering Island, Steller was able to gather considerable information on the habits of the sea cow, as well as an extensive set of measurements of various parts of the sea cow's anatomy, allowing scientists to reconstruct the animal around skeletons that have survived. Hans Rothauscher has posted an excellent site, in both English and German, showing the progression and possible errors in such reconstructions of the sea cow.

      The meat of the sea cow, which was most often referred to as being similar to veal, remained fresh for much longer than any other available meat source, making it extremely valuable to the Russian sailors and hunters. The fat was described as tasting like sweet almond-oil. Although Bering's crew only killed their first sea cow six weeks before their escape in August 1742, the meat was crucial in restoring their strength during the final stages of building a new boat from the wreckage of the St. Peter. When they left, they took a supply of meat and fat, and stories of the incredible riches of the islands for fur hunters. Those hunters flocked to the area, and in 1768, explorer Martin Sauer entered in his journal an account of the death of the last known sea cow.

      Manatees and dugongs are the focus of worldwide conservation efforts to ensure that they don't share the fate of the Steller's sea cow. There is still a chance, though, that the sea cow isn't extinct. In the years since their generally-accepted extinction in 1768, there have been occasional reports suggesting that small colonies may have survived by moving to areas away from the Russian hunting grounds. In the mid-1800s, such reports were not unusual, and as recently as 1962, the crew of a Russian whaler reported seeing six animals that resembled sea cows, feeding in a bay in the Gulf of Anadyr. In 1977, a fisherman in Kamchatka reported actually touching a drifting animal that matched the description of a sea cow. But for now, those reports are just considered to be rumours, fuel for yet another Northern myth.</groundspeak:long_description>

This area looked good for “running up the numbers” because the symbols on the map were fairly dense and I hadn’t really visited the area much before yesterday. By sunset I had pedaled about 28.3 miles and collected twenty-seven smiley faces. Had arranged budget lodging in Sunnyvale. This saved time driving back and forth as well as keeping my carbon footprint down a bit. This was the seventh of thirty-four smiley faces for today. TNLNSL. I would pedal about 36.61 miles between dawn and dusk today. TFTC! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Now that I've solved all the Babe caches, I thought I'd make my
own.
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GCGMP8"&gt;Prospero&lt;/a&gt;
had a problem. He had to not deal with one Babe, but two. After
receiving some pickup lines from all his geeky and esoteric
friends, he thought he was ready to get his own Babes. He sought
the Babes of his dreams, but according to human societal norms, he
could only have one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Prospero devised a test to give to his Primitive Primate
Babes to determine whom he would have as his one and only Babe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Babes were put in a room, each with a typewriter. The Babes
had some experience with programming and typing, so Prospero knew
it would be a snap. Prospero said a single sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Put enough monkeys in a room with a typewriter and they'll
produce Shakespeare."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Babe began typing up something that looked like it
came from a primitive tarpit, it was like a program, but with a
source code resembling a Shakespeareian play!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prospero's Babe
Test for the Two Primitive Babes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Romeo, a young handsome
man with pickup lines aplenty.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Juliet, a youthful
pretty Babe who's heard them all.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Act I: Trouble In
Venona&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Scene I: Romeo And
Juliet's Discovery of Puzzle Caches&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;[Enter Romeo and
Juliet]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Juliet: You lying stupid
fatherless big smelly half-witted coward! You are as stupid as the
difference between a handsome rich brave hero and
thyself!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Romeo: You are as stupid
as the sum of a beautiful flower and a blossoming black tree! You
are as lonely as the sum of Romeo and thyself! Speak your
mind!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Juliet: You rich lovely
handsome brave huge tree! Speak YOUR mind!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Romeo: You are a stupid
devil! You are as trustworthy as the difference of a tree and
thyself! Open your heart!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Juliet: You are a vile
furry chihuahua. You are as clever as the sum of Juliet and
thyself! Open your heart!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Romeo: You are an

brave brave man. Speak your mind!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Juliet: You sweet pretty

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Romeo: You bottomless

cousin and a graceful tree! Open your heart!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Juliet: You are as
fat-kidneyed as the product of a golden beautiful graceful angel
and a trusty worried tree. You are as distasteful as the sum of
thyself and Juliet! You are as distasteful as the sum of thyself
and Juliet! You are as dusty as the sum of thyself and a delicious
mistletoe! Speak your mind!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Romeo: Open your heart!
OPEN YOUR HEART!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Juliet: You blister! You
are as snotty as the sum of a black blue bold moon and thyself!
Open your heart!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Romeo: Am I greater than
you?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Juliet: If so, let us
proceed to Act II.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;Act II: The One
Where They Exeunt&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scene I: The First
Scene Of The Last Act Which Would Be First Scene In The Act Where
They Shall Exeunt.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size="2" face="Lucida Console"&gt;[Exeunt]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font lucida="" console=""&gt;&lt;font&gt;The second Babe looked at the
play, and said "Tsk, tsk." (As orangutans often say.) Being an
orangutan, he altered the program with a program of his own, one of
punctuation. (It's a common fact orangutans use gratuitious amounts
of punctuation.)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the obligatory 15 minutes, Prospero returned to see what
the Babes had written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prospero looked at the two pickup lines that the two Babes wrote
for him, and just grinned. "These programming primates certainly
can program, and they have a certain charm to them as well." He
thought to himself, in a sililoquy a lá Shakespeare. Prospero
walked out of the room, pickup lines swirling in his head, with one
Babe in each hand.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I was monkeying around with an idea for a puzzle, decided to do some research, when a web page I read reminded me of something I saw a while back. I quickly pulled up this page, and went to work on it. Similar to many of the other solvers, I needed to make some editorial changes to the script, but at the end of it, the play was complete. Perhaps not quite what the Bard would have written, but it was certainly good enough. My original idea was actually (and appropriately) more closely related to the second part, and that part gave up its secret much more readily, as I am a regular kind of person [:D]

Came by today to sign the log. I predict that there will be a lot more finders of this one in a few weeks. Thanks for a fun one!</groundspeak:text>

I see there are no cache sites in this area so I thought I would give it a try. If this works out I will do some more in the area and let's have some fun.

The cache is much bigger than a 35mm canister. It held nuts. There is a pen in it but bring a pen with you any way,you never know. And please, please, you do not need to go on any other property or into any yards.

This is a place where Muggels walk by a lot, so keep a look out for them, thay may come out of now where. Durng school time the Muggels a alot before and after school.
There are some taiding items and bugs. Please, remember if you take something out, put something in and try to put it back where you found it.
Thank you.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">Kablooey has complained I sometimes use clues in my puzzles, so I
thought I would try to create one I consider to be using clues. The
following is entirely true and may give you some insight about me.
During my childhood unlike everyone I knew, my family didn't have a
mailbox at our house. We'd make nearly daily trips to the local
post office. P.O. Box 835 Saratoga, was my address for years. This
was a real problem especially with schools, libraries, DMV, and
other places that insisted on knowing where I lived. The reason
this was a problem is that I would have to give them the location
of the house I lived in, but I would also give them my box number;
the address where letters were to be sent. At an age younger than
my kids I had to take responsibility to always remind people, of my
box number, because I wouldn't receive letters sent anywhere else.
In those days the information was all in paper files that rarely
had the forethought to allow for two addresses. Even if the
paperwork had a location for two addresses they frequently were not
used correctly, or were ignored. Over the years many people have
had trouble using my box number, and sent letters into that void
and never found me. I learned early on that I needed to focus and
remind people where to send me letters or I would be the one,
missing out on things. These experiences taught me about rampant
bureaucratic incompetence at an early age. This is no longer my
address location. That Post Office in Saratoga was closed, and was
converted into a Sheriff substation. They built a new Post Office
on top of what had been the baseball fields of my Jr. High. For a
time as an adult in another city I even had a P.O. Box ending in
the same number. I no longer have any of these box numbers and
don't reside in either of these cities, but to me it will always be
my box address. I forgot to put a pencil in the cache which, I will
hopefully fix eventually. I’d preferred to have made this a regular
cache, but I think if it were a traditional, or larger that it
would be muggled, but maybe I'm just being conservative. 5/1/09 I
added a pencil to this box, and increased the difficulties a
little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional Waypoints&lt;/p&gt;</groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>The dummy coordinates are near a Post Office where we scored an FTF on the day they don't deliver letters.  
No virtual ivy here, the only numbers to be found are obvious.  
Given the last sentence, there are no coordinates on this page.  When you find the coordinates, you should be able to tell that you likely have the right set.  
The title "Between dissimilar landmarks" has nothing to do with the story or the puzzle, so why would I use it, and what could it mean?
Title is a hide location hint, and the landmarks center to center are within ten feet of each other.
Location hint: Between post and rock.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I've heard about the benefits of "a hug a day" and even seen claims that twelve a day will ensure great emotional health. All I know is that after going out with my geofriends this morning, I'm sure feeling upbeat and cheery! [:D]

Of course, a big part of that might have been "solving" this long-standing, head-scratching puzzle. I actually first traded ideas on it last year with mokelly, but every path I tried following led absolutely nowhere. Bah humbug -- I eventually threw in the towel.

Thus, when The Rat pinged me, Winterwolfe, and thegirlsfromPA about taking another look, I was highly skeptical we'd get anywhere. I shouldn't have been so doubtful! In fact, the dawning realization as to the solution was totally a priceless moment, leaving me grinning ear to ear and feeling incredibly grateful to have been included. And our celebratory hug at the final location was definitely icing on the cake!

As we signed the remarkably clean logsheet, I remarked that in retrospect, it all makes perfect sense. Oh well -- hindsight being 20/20 and all that, I'm more than happy to say TFTC!</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">The Rat asked us to join forces in tackling this one and shared with us his findings so far. Unbeknownst to him, he had already solved this puzzle, but had managed to talk himself out of it. A few emails back and forth and we all decided to visit his original idea and low and behold, there was indeed a cache there. Pretty nice to have a tricky puzzle solution delivered right to our email accounts. Enjoyed the quick morning-time gathering to socialize with thelins, The Rat and ThegirlsfromPA. Thanks for the puzzle, OAP.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This puzzle is a little out of range of our large stack of "nearest, but not solved" but I have glanced at it a couple of times.  Having had PO Boxes over the years, I understand the serendipity you feel when a number repeats itself.  I moved away from an area and gave up a PO Box once.  When I moved back three years later, oddly enough, the only PO Box of that size available was the same one that I had before! 

This little personal history didn't help at all, though, when it came to solving the puzzle.  Scant though the number of logs is, I did find information that was helpful in eliminating a few square miles of possibilities.  When put together with The Rat's information, the combination produced an "ah, ha" and he had it all.  

Today, we were grateful to join in The Rat's bevy (and group hugs) and gather together to make the find along with Winterwolfe and Thelins.</groundspeak:text>

He generously gave me just what I needed. I had been too focused on the word "post" but once off that tack I managed to find my way to the solution. Except I didn't realize I had found the solution until I recruited a phalanx of beautiful women for a sanity check, who basically told me that had to be the solution. So we all met there today and quickly found the cache. Group hugs are nice. Thanks to the CO and my bevy of helpers.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is hidden in the Palo Alto baylands, a sliver of wetland
that hasn't been claimed for housing or industrial development. The
undeveloped nature of the baylands didn't come around through
benign neglect - it was the result of people who understood this
natural resource for what it is and fought to save it.
&lt;p&gt;Three features of the baylands carry names of those who cared
about and worked to save them. Emily Renzel, Lucy Evans and Harriet
Mundy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stage 1: &amp;nbsp; N 37 26.873 W 122 07.026
&lt;p&gt;You are looking at the Emily Renzel Wetlands. At this spot
you'll find a mile marker sign with this text&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;"Trail Route - 0.Y Mi to Adobe Jct. 0.Z Mi to San Francisquito
Trail Jct."&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Add Y to Z to get &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/8d1bdd31-8c65-4523-b134-622b3310247f.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Emily Renzel&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Emily Renzel Wetlands restoration project was completed in
1992, utilizing a $1,000,000 grant from the California Coastal
Conservancy to enhance the salt marsh portion of wetlands with bay
water, and creating a new 15-acre fresh water pond. The freshwater
pond uses pumped reclaimed water from the nearby Palo Alto Regional
Water Quality Control Plant. Shortly after the wetland restoration
and pond project was completed, the area was named after former
City Councilmember Emily Renzel for her tireless work over 20 years
to preserve and protect Palo Alto's Baylands. Ms. Renzel was also a
principal sponsor of the City's park dedication ordinance that
protects park and open space land from any form of public or
private development without the expressed consent of Palo Alto
voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; The city of Palo Alto is studying the feasibility
of allowing auto dealers to relocate to the frontage road abutting
the marsh. Read about it &lt;a href=
"http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/show_story.php?id=1646" target=
"_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stage 2: &amp;nbsp; N 37 27.580 &amp;nbsp; W 122 06.383
&lt;p&gt;You are at the Lucy Evans Interpretive Center. There is a plaque
here whose first line contains a single digit followed by the word
STAR in very large letters. Subtract 1 from that digit to get
&lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/b7fac07b-928a-44ad-8d7b-32bcac27098a.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Lucy Evans&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy Evans, born in Wyoming in 1903, came to California with her
family at the age of two. She graduated from Stanford in 1929,
having been elected to Phi Beta Kappa. She taught at Mayfield
School for 23 years. Class field trips led to her joining the
Audubon Society and exploring the Baylands extensively. A friend
has said that "she knew every inch" of them. She fought for the
preservation of the Baylands, and her determination earned her the
appellation "Baylands Lucy." She died suddenly in 1978. The
Baylands Nature Interpretive Center was rededicated to her memory
in December 1978.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stage 3: N 37 27.693 &amp;nbsp; W 122 06.286
&lt;p&gt;You are at the Harriet Mundy Marsh. One of the plaques at this
viewing stand contains panoramic pictures by Eric Goetze. The last
digit of the copyright date is &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/76b404ed-6691-4eb3-81f0-059dc4a231f6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Harriet Mundy&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Harriet Mundy Marsh, dedicated on October 23, 1982, extends
from Lucy Evans Nature Interpretive Center to Sand Point. Harriet
Mundy "discovered" the Baylands when she was advised to walk after
a fall in 1959. She became a close friend of Lucy Evans and joined
her in the resolve to help preserve the Palo Alto marshland. A $30
million private proposal to develop the Palo Alto Baylands for
commercial and industrial use spurred Mundy to action. In 1960 she
helped to circulate a petition which resulted in the City Council
stopping development until a Baylands Master Plan was prepared. The
naming of the marsh recognizes her continued perseverance and
devotion to the marshlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stage 4: N 37 27.ACB &amp;nbsp; W 122.06.AAB. Total walking
distance for all of the stages is about 2 miles. Don't ignore the
closing time posted at the entrance - it is strictly enforced.&lt;/li&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I've been meaning to do this cache for a while, but also thought it would be a good one to save for introducing someone new to geocaching. Finding one multi-cache with a bit of an educational component somehow seems more memorable than finding a bunch of similar traditionals.
Today I was introducing a new person to geocaching, and this was a convenient location to meet. I had the impression that the round trip distance would be 2 miles and that the final would be on the way back, so it was about twice as far as we expected, but that was fine. Despite running a half marathon in the morning, Gary didn't seem to mind a 4 mile walk too much. 
The walk was beautiful, as expected, and we found the numbers we needed. The cool surprise was running into some other geocachers at the final. Gary and I had been searching for a few minutes when some cyclists approached. They quickly identified themselves as geocachers, so we didn't have to explain ourselves. They called themselves reschen. They started searching where we had just searched, with a similar lack of luck. I was starting to worry that my carefully selected introductory cache would be a failure, but after expanding the search radius reschen discovered the cache. Success! We each had some travel bugs we'd been carrying too long (I'd even brought it to Japan and back), so we swapped the travel bugs.
Thanks for a well designed multi-cache.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This one had me utterly baffled every time I looked at it.  Nothing stood out at all as a theme or a place to start.  So, when I hadn't looked at it for a while, I was surprised to find the title changed, and the description cleaned up a bit.  Suddenly, things began to click.  I was tweeting with the CO (or, I should say TO the CO) while I was working on it and the solution came to me as I tweeted my thoughts.  I guess instead of letting the cat out of the bag, I think a little bird must have told me.  Anyway, worked it out and went to sign the log today.
When I arrived at the location, I approached the area cautiously.  The previous cache at this location had drawn some anger from a homeowner nearby, and the fellow apparently heaped abuse upon a cacher.  Since no one seems to have incurred the wrath of said homeowner with this cache, perhaps the man has moved away, or gotten a more cheerful disposition.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! [:O]

Good grief, Charlie Brown, I FIGURED IT OUT!!!!!! And now that I've crawled my way out from mokelly's pile of 700 bricks (a warning would have been nice, sir), I can do my trademark dance of joy, text all my geofriends, and shout to the neighbors, HA!

Let me just say that for a minute there, I was really sweating. On our puzzle run today, Winterwolfe suggested that we stop by and make this find, confident that I could solve it by day's end. Really? Really?? REALLY??? (I didn't have the heart to tell her how much fruitless time I'd already invested........)

Thunderbolts and lightening, really! To my incredulous surprise, it turned out that I'd started my engine and chugged down the right track fairly early on, but then...I was confounded and took a horribly wrong detour instead. A very...long...detour. [:(]

Well, there's apparently nothing like signing a logsheet to provide the necessary motivation to get un-lost. Skeptical but fingers crossed, I spread out my roadmap again for the umpteenth time and nervously watched the day's minutes and hours tick-tick-tick away until.....ZOWIE-ZING -- TO THE MOON! [:D]

Perfectly in time for dinner and the rest of my long evening, because just in case you weren't sure if I was crazy, I'm about to hit the road in this wildly stormy weather to head for Tahoe. At least I'll have this beautiful solution to keep me warm as I'm crawling along at 1.5 mph.

My current baffling index is 1.97. I think. But my math is never trustworthy. [;)]</groundspeak:text>

what will yield the

[post-FTF hints]

You're looking for 6 numbers. The text editor "Microsoft Word" provides one with 6 numbers. Another text editor I tested provides one with 7 numbers, and another text editor I tested provides one with but 2 numbers. But even if you've one that provides but a single number, it should provide a pseudo-Aha moment as to how to continue.

One of these numbers is 37. Another is 122.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

I admittedly looked at the hint to get me going in the right direction, and the basic gist turned out to be something that's all too familiar to me. Yet despite my everyday experience with the matter, getting the right coords took much longer than I'd expected. Applied quite a lot of tinkering and canoodling, made one assumption, and AT LAST, Homer said, "OK." Phew! Glad to knock another off the still-must-solve list!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">In 2000, I found a perfect bike for my family: a Santana Cabrio triplet tandem. The 3 seat ride was always a head turner. Best of all, the kids always arrived at the destination at the same time I did. We rode 50K and 100K events in the Wine Country, Chico, Davis, Southern California, and locally. On downhills we could hit 60 mph. Alas, one good thing came to an end, and we sold it to another family.

The microcache is a sign-only LPC micro, not constrained by any business hours. The shop knew about the hide when it was next to the shop backdoor, but one too many cachers jiggled the electrical box.

a local history lesson or perhaps something concerning natural

"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sm%C3%B6rg%C3%A5sbord" target=
"_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, a Smörgåsbord is a
"Scandinavian meal served buffet-style with multiple dishes of
various foods on a table." However, it notes that in an extended
sense "the word is used to refer to any situation which invites
patrons to select whatever they wish among several pleasant things,
such as the smorgasbord of university courses, books in a
bookstore, etc." For this puzzle the pleasant things you have to
choose from is a table of signature item products.
&lt;p&gt;When I first started geocaching it wasn't long before I
encountered my first sigitem, a niraD token retrieved from State of
Confusion. The more I geocached, the more signature items I
encountered until I decided I wanted a signature item of my own. I
found an item that is small, so it will fit in most caches. And it
was inexpensive in bulk, so I obtained a bunch of them.
Subsequently I've been placing my sigitems in most of the local
caches I find, as well as in the caches I hide. And thanks to
Marky's &lt;a href="http://www.sigitem.com" target="_blank" rel=
"nofollow"&gt;sigitem tracking site&lt;/a&gt; I've been able to watch as
some of my sigitems travel around (and outside) the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I've been caching I've left sigitems and other trade-able
swag, and I have obtained quite a few sigitems in exchange. At
first I liked the idea of collecting them, but over time I realized
that I already collect too many things. So I then came up with
theidea of making the sigitems I've collected available for others
to trade, and that is the idea behind this cache. The cache is
originally stocked with all of the sigitems you see in the table
below, as well as many others. You are free to trade for any of the
sigitems, but please &lt;b&gt;trade&lt;/b&gt; so that the cache stays well
stocked. Note that you can click on each image to get a bigger
view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You aren't going to see any breathtaking scenery, any marsh
fowl, or planes but it does satisfy another perk, which is it is
available 24 hours. Obviously it was placed with the hiking/biking
loop in mind, but it can also be done as a quick grab and go.
During business hours some stealth might be required. Don't forget
a pen!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 I was out looking for &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GCK1ZA"&gt;Skyline
Snowman&lt;/a&gt; when a vicious stick jumped up and attacked me, giving
me a gash in my knee. Nevermind the fact that I shouldn't have been
wearing shorts - it hurt! When I logged it, the owner, &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=7c495b6d-86e1-4964-91f5-62bcb260324e"&gt;
WeBeDnD&lt;/a&gt;, took pity on me and fashioned me a Purple Heart for my
injury. A few weeks later he was attacked by a swarm of bees at
&lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GCK98J"&gt;one
of my caches&lt;/a&gt; and earned his own Purple Heart. 
&lt;p&gt;This cache is for all of us who've been injured in the noble
cause of finding a cache. The hide is nothing special (it's a black
tube-like container); but in your log, please tell a story of a
geocaching-related injury deserving of The Purple Heart. The more
entertaining the story, the better. And you get bonus points if the
injury was a result of your own stupidity or stubbornness.&lt;/p&gt;

As we get more experience--and get better at finding other caches!--we'll make future hides more challenging, but this one is pretty simple.  It's easy to get to on foot or bike and, while it's in a public space next to Oregon Expressway, it's out of sight to most Muggles!

Update (1/3/11):  based on feedback on several logs (thanks!) we're upgrading this from 1 to 1.5 for difficulty and terrain.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Oregon Expressway was opened for traffic in May of 1964, after 90 homes were moved or destroyed to make this link between highway 101 and Alma St (it becomes Page Mill Rd. at Alma).  Originally the expressway was to be a fenced-in extension of Highway 101 with only two access points (at Louis and Middlefield), causing alarm among many citizens that Palo Alto would be permanently divided between 'north' and 'south.'  Recent proposals to increase the traffic flow on the expressway by closing off several existing intersections have renewed public controversy.</groundspeak:long_description>

hidden in a nice neighborhood park.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This park became available in Feb. 2008 when its previous cache was
archived. I'd had my eye on this park for a long time, and when it
became available I pounced! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I put a mediocre (lame) cache here just to hold the location until
I could put together something a little bit better. Of course, it
took me longer than I expected to actually follow through and put a
better cache here. But, it is here now. So the old "MaryMead Park"
cache is archived, and this new "Marymeade - Notso Lame" cache is
here for your enjoyment. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Please place the rolled up log sheet into the inner sleeve
BEFORE fastening the cap onto the container.&lt;/b&gt; This will help
make the log sheet last longer and it will make it easier for the
next finder to extract.</groundspeak:long_description>

It is located within a few feet of the sidewalk and there is no need to trample on any foliage or set foot off the concrete.

The closest legal parking is probably at the intersection of Matadero Avenue and Laguna Avenue. A well-maintained bike path connects Hanover Street to Matadero Avenue.

It is best attempted during daylight hours or at the weekend when no one is around.

Update 12/13/11: Based on feedback, I raised the difficulty to 2.5 and will happily raise it further if people wish. Correctly setting the difficulty levels can be "difficult".

Update 12/23/11: Based on feedback and the high DNF rate, I raised the difficulty to 3.5.

I finally had to archive the original cache. 

Since this is a nice location for a cache, I have set up a replacement .

Hopefully, the new version will not be muggled.

Due to the nearby residences, it is probably advisable not to attempt this one at night.

Good luck.</groundspeak:long_description>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that Sunnyvale has its own flock of wild parrots?
Did you know that a group of parrots can also be called a
&lt;b&gt;pandemonium of parrots&lt;/b&gt;? It tells you something about the
noise a wild flock of parrots can make because the definition of
pandemonium is "wild uproar or noise!" (Source: American Heritage
Dictionary). You can also call them a company of parrots. Well
Sunnyvale does and not only that, they roost very near here! And
what a pandemonium they are capable of making! Most of the birds in
this flock are cherry-headed conures. Conures are Mexican, Central
or South American birds. They didn't migrate here. Instead, the
flock probably started with a few escaped pets. Due to our mild
weather and availability of suitable food, these tropical birds
have been able to thrive. You can read more about our Sunnyvale
flock in this article: &lt;a href=
"http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/08.20.98/slices-9833.html"&gt;
&lt;font color="#0000A0"&gt;Concrete Jungle&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently there are flocks of wild parrots also in Palo Alto as
well in San Francisco. You can read more about Bay Area wild
parrots here: &lt;a href=
"http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2007/01/11/18345852.php"&gt;&lt;font color="#0000A0"&gt;
Parrots Withstand Cold Weather...&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While researching wild parrots I found an interesting ad on Yelp
for an apartment right here in the Villa Cerise complex. It reads:
&lt;i&gt;"The interesting thing about Villa Cerise is that there is a
company (ie, flock) of wild parrots that resides in Sunnyvale and
visits the rooftops of Villa Cerise in the morning and late
afternoon each day. The parrots are noisy, but when else will you
live someplace with wild parrots on your block?!"&lt;/i&gt; I've seen a
lot of different selling points for real estate but a pandemonium
is new to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to The North Star for FTF!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I come to visit the Sunnyvale Baylands quite often, and I always drive past these awesome living organisms. Eucalyptus is one of my favorite trees, because of it's unique fresh scent and the overall appearance of the tree itself. But this area is a little suspicious to me...why are there so many in this one spot? The band of trees begin at one side of the Sunnyvale Dump/Landfill, and end at the other! Anyone who has driven past here on a still day knows what that smells like...especially along with the wafting SF Bay smell 1/4 mile north of here.


One day Ica187 pondered something as we were driving past the trees to go Geocaching. She says " These tree's must be here to cover up that smell...look how they line the perimeter of the dump!". I had never thought about it until that day, and it is amusingly plausible. I mean, what other explanation could there be? A bunch of Eucalyptus trees lining a landfull...Its a big cover-up to mask the smell!


Geocache is a regular sized container, hidden with natural camo.
And please be sure to take your time replacing the camo once you
have finished signing the log.

Creek was named "Permanente" by the Spanish because it was a
reliable source of water that didn't dry up in the summer. It flows
through land formerly owned by the Kaiser Cement Company. The
company was started by Henry J. Kaiser, who had a house in the
hills next to Permanente Creek. He also created Kaiser Permanente,
one of the country's earliest, and now largest, HMO for his
employees. Kaiser Permanente was named after the creek.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Plan of the day was to continue trying to “run up the numbers.” Yesterday morning I had loaded my favoured caching conveyance on the back of the motorcar and journeyed to Sunnyvale. This area looked good for “running up the numbers” because the symbols on the map were fairly dense and I hadn’t really visited the area much before yesterday. By sunset I had pedaled about 28.3 miles and collected twenty-seven smiley faces. Had arranged budget lodging in Sunnyvale. This saved time driving back and forth as well as keeping my carbon footprint down a bit. This was the fifteenth of thirty-four smiley faces for today. TNLNSL. I would pedal about 36.61 miles between dawn and dusk today. TFTC! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The listed coordinates are the starting point of a virtual journey
that ends at the cache.&amp;nbsp; For the first part or leg of the
journey you'll travel north, a given distance.&amp;nbsp; For the second
leg of the journey you'll travel east, half the distance that you
traveled on the first leg.&amp;nbsp; For the third leg of the journey
you'll travel south, half the distance that you traveled on the
previous leg.&amp;nbsp; You'll continue to travel on these legs until
you're no longer traversing any measurable distance but are simply
rotating in place.&amp;nbsp; Stop, you've arrived at the cache.&amp;nbsp;
An interesting and important fact is that if you add up all the
distances that you've traveled the total will be exactly 5
minutes.&amp;nbsp; Yes, the distances you travel on the legs of this
virtual journey are to be measured in units of angular
minutes.&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;It's time for our second safety themed geocache series. This
time around the theme is Hand Safety! We can't reach our goal of
ZERO injuries until we eliminate ALL hand injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical cache is a tupperware container located adjacent to
the Sunnyvale Water Treatment ponds. Please keep in mind that there
is a healthy gopher snake population in the area, and at times the
bugs are thicker than the smell. Safety glasses are not an uncommon
sight on these trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hand Safety cache series was placed with your safety in
mind. You may have to step over a few weeds to get this one, and
you may need to move some &amp;ldquo;objects&amp;rdquo; that weigh up to 10
pounds in order to find this cache, so a pinch could be possible.
Also check carefully for any of the local wildlife that might also
think this is a great place to hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this cache is to familiarize you with 10 Hand
Hazards that commonly lead to hand injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a list of 10 Hand Hazards that are responsible for the
majority of hand injuries in the workplace. This list is not all
inclusive, but it does capture the majority of hand injuries. In
the Beyond Safety workplace we address these hazards BEFORE we
begin our work. Check out the gallery for more information on each
of these 10 Hand Hazards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#1 - Caught Between / Pinch Points&lt;br /&gt;
#2 - Sharp Object Hazards&lt;br /&gt;
#3 - Slip, Trip, and Fall Hazards&lt;br /&gt;
#4 - Repetitive Stress (Ergonomic) Hazards&lt;br /&gt;

#9 &amp;ndash; Chemical, Electrical, &amp;amp; Pressure Hazards&lt;br /&gt;

Mother &amp; son were already bored to death and missed this easy grab by me and my daughter.
Will have to buy her either a BMX or a mountain bike though rather than a toy bike for this kind of terrain ...

mile. *&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have been fascinated by geometric figures recently. To determine
the coordinates, you will need values for K, S, B, T, and H. These
can be derived by examining the figures below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 K: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/c92da79b-d0b9-414c-96ad-01f4ef2703f6.jpg" /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
 S: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/7bfc0bd1-206c-403c-a202-f595dd13ac19.jpg" /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
B: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/dacd4676-9b50-41af-86c4-0617d6aea3c3.jpg" /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
T: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/534a576d-2212-48fa-a992-edc5f66aa727.jpg" /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
H: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/80ea9239-9080-4a32-ae4f-88a6429c0f01.jpg" /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
The answers for K, S, B, T, and H add up to a number whose last
digit is 8. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 The coordinates are: &lt;br /&gt;
N37 20.(T+B)(T-S)(K-H)&lt;br /&gt;
W122 T.(T+H)(B+H)(K-S)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
GPSr accuracy should be reasonable - my Garmin was giving about
10ft accuracy. Nearby parking is very limited. It is hanging around
eye-level and should not be visible from the golf course side.

previous ones are: &lt;br /&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I noticed that this cache has been temporarily disabled for a period of time well in excess of "a few weeks" as contemplated by the cache guidelines published on Geocaching.com. While I feel that Geocaching.com should hold the location for you and block other caches from entering the area around this cache for a reasonable amount of time, we can't do so forever.

If you plan on repairing this cache in the near future, please log a note to the cache stating your plans (don't email me) so I don't archive the listing for non-communication.

Please repair/replace this cache as soon as convenient. If you have decided this cache's time has come to and end, please archive it (using the archive listing link in the upper right) so that someone else can place a cache in the area, and geocachers can once again enjoy visiting this location.

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Special Notes about the 2012 Puzzle Challenge:&lt;/b&gt; To be considered for Fastest Solver points, you must verify your solution with &lt;a href="http://certitude.comxa.com/certitude.php?wp=GC39X73"&gt;certitude&lt;/a&gt;. If you have worked as a team (or otherwise shared knowledge), please email me separately, so that points can be distributed correctly. All "point" scoring is arbitrary anyway, subject to change, at the discretion of the cache owner, and probably completely meaningless (unless you just want to be announced sooner at the December banquet). The real challenge is just to see whether you can solve all of these caches by the end of the year. To maintain fairness, hints should not be offered by the cache owner or other solvers until the fifteenth of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Special Notes about this month's puzzle:&lt;/b&gt; Typically the January puzzle is supposed to be somewhat easy. This one is rated at 4-star difficulty because of multiple parts, but if you've solved kablooey puzzles in the past, I don't think it should offer too much trouble. [Obviously, I was overly optimistic here; so I bumped the difficulty up to 4.5 based on the first four days of activity.] However, I'm requiring EXTRA digits this month (which will make things quite a bit harder for Certitude brute-forcers). I picked up a bag of trash when I placed the cache. I'm sure there is plenty more in the general area for the CITO-minded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First To Solve: &lt;b&gt;jimbexleyspeed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I set it aside when the February KPC was published and didn’t look at it again until sleuthers contacted me a few of days ago. Apparently he read my Avoid the Nimitz log where I mentioned that I hadn’t solved this one yet. I told him what I had and what I expected the next step to be. He agreed with my assessment and narrowed my focus. He also provided some insight on how the data was organized; which turned out to be the key. I can’t believe, like this month’s KPC, that I discounted the solution [B)]. I guess the more puzzles you solve, it’s only natural to see the same encode twice (or three times [;)]).

This hill has many memories for me as it was where I constantly walked my 3 Golden Retrievers: Bentley, Brigette and Molly with my dad growing up, where one of my nephews crashed hilariously at the bottom for not knowing where the brakes on a scooter were and where I filled the streets with countless cars for many a raging teenage party in high school ;)

Park at the bottom of the hill right across from or right next to the cache it doesn't matter as long as you don't leave your car parked there unattended the neighbors won't care.  There are four houses directly surrounding the cache and usually bikers, runners and dog walkers out and about so some stealthiness may be required depending on the time of your visit.  

This cache is a small camo'd metal cylinder with plastic caps and is suitable for small trade items (coins and swag mainly) but most TBs won't fit if they're attached to bigger items.  Original cache contains a few keychains, bottlecaps, a small Canon memory card and a nail clipper. Also, a "The Washers California 2006 Geocoin" goes to the FTF!

There is no need to trample on any foliage or leave the sidewalk. It is at ground level. 

The closest legal parking is on South California Avenue.

It is best attempted during daylight hours or at the weekend when no one is around.

01/31/2012 Update: Increased difficulty to 3 based on high DNF rate and will raise it even further if people wish.

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">This cache placement is dedicated to the Town &amp; Gown cooperation in which Stanford built this impressive athletic facility on their land and leased it to the City of Palo Alto for $1 per year for 50 years in exchange for the City permitting the University to expand their educational and research facilities.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is a three-stage cache that may easily be done on foot.  The given coordinates locate you in the parking lot for the new soccer field facility on the corner of El Camino Real and Page Mill Road in Palo Alto.  (You should be at the plaque closest to Page Mill Rd)  

Facing the fields are six (6) plaques describing some of the history of this area.  From information gathered on these signs, you will determine the coordinates for the second stage.  At that stage, you will gather additional information required to find the final cache location.  

The cache is a magnetic key container.  Bring your own pencil/pen to sign the log.  There is a Sacajawea dollar in the container for the First to Find!


*** Determine A &amp; B for the coordinates of STAGE 2 at  N 37 deg  25.A;  W 122 deg  08.B
    
A = a1 minus a2 plus a3   (Checksum = 15)  where

a1 - Numerical address where the two entrepreneuers rented their shop space.

a2 - The number of years from the start of construction to the demolition of "Mayfield's finest public building"

a3 - The last digit of the year the Mayfield town site was plotted.


B = b1 minus (6 times b2) plus b3  (Checksum = 20) where

b1 - Numerical address of the first tenant of the Stanford Research Park 

b2 - The sum of the digits in the year Leland Stanford arranged to have University Park named Palo Alto

b3 - The last digit in the year Jesus Ramos farmed land across Page Mill Road.

These coordinates will take you to the vicinity of 440 Page Mill Road; the site of the L. P. Institute of Science and Medicine until about 15 years ago.  You will, however, need to have the exact values for A &amp; B to determine the final cache location.

***  Determine C &amp; D from the work of art along this wall for the coordinates of STAGE 3, the cache location:

  N 37 deg  25.C;  W 122 deg  08.D

C = A - X - 4   (Checksum = 10) 

X - The number of letters in the first six words of the four-line protest sign shown on one of the ceramic tiles.

D = B + 2(Y + 3)    (Checksum = 17)  
Y - The number of words in the quote (shown on two tiles) by the man to whom this mural is dedicated.  (Caution!  One word looks like two words.)

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;The cache is not at the coordinates
listed above, but is within 3 miles of
them.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The actual coordinates for this micro cache are in the story below.
The cache is located near a place where you could study topics that
would help you solve the puzzle.&lt;br /&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The scene: A restaurant near E.U. headquarters. At the bar, some
E.U. staff members are getting together for an after-work drink.
The bartender greets them and asks, "How are you all today?"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Johann: "Dry, Pascal! Give me a beer please."&lt;br /&gt;
Jean-Luc: "Set me up with some red wine, please."&lt;br /&gt;
Alejandro: "A dose of tequila for me, Pascal...Ah, this was worth
exploring Mexico for! Wait, what's this?"&lt;br /&gt;
Carlos: "A trace of a worm, perhaps?"&lt;br /&gt;
Johann: "Fear not, Alejandro, it won't bite you. It's dead!"&lt;br /&gt;
Jean-Luc: "Cease and desist please, gentlemen! You're ruining my
appetite."&lt;br /&gt;
Johann: "Phnnf! It sounds like you have too fragile a constitution,
my friend!"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In another part of the restaurant, an E.U. staffer reads a book
while waiting for friends to arrive. They walk up to her table, and
one of them asks what she's reading.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Frederika: "Ayn Rand."&lt;br /&gt;
Etienne: "Duh! Of course--&lt;i&gt;The Fountainhead&lt;/i&gt;. I should have
recognized it."&lt;br /&gt;
Soledad: "You know, speaking of novels from the '40s, I've finally
been reading &lt;i&gt;Brideshead Revisited&lt;/i&gt; as you suggested, Etienne.
I'm just up to the part where Julia breaks up with Charles. Poor
Charles!"&lt;br /&gt;
Etienne: "Sank his hopes, yes, but she had to do it."&lt;br /&gt;
Frederika: "Knowing her religious background, I wonder why he ever
thought it would work out. I guess he expected her to
change."&lt;br /&gt;
Etienne: "Unfairly, if you ask me."&lt;br /&gt;
Soledad: "See, Etienne, I knew you'd take Julia's side!"&lt;br /&gt;
Juanita: "Oh, Chole, it sounds like Etienne will never admit that
Julia is flighty!"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;------------------------------------------&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because the cache is small, you'll need to bring your own pen.
Also, there isn't much room for trade items. But I did manage to
fit in one of my signature crystal snowflakes as a First to Find
prize.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you get to the cache location, be sure to watch the field for
a while; you may see squirrels, rabbits, or burrowing owls. Bring
your binoculars--and the kids!&lt;br /&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first tried to solve cachbefound's &lt;a href="http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=c782b84b-2e93-4d6f-a2ff-efd10cb058ee"&gt;Pie Filling&lt;/a&gt;, my brain really wanted the solution to be found by entirely the wrong method. I eventually whacked my brain cells into seeing the correct method, but they were so stuck on that other idea that I had to make a new puzzle to keep them happy. After all, the Bay Area can't possible have enough pie puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to duplicate cachbefound's mother's recipe where I could, but I couldn't find any square pie pans, so I had to settle for a rectangular one. I also wanted to make it a gooseberry pie (my favorite), but I couldn't find any gooseberry pie filling, so I decided to go with cherry. That certainly matches the cherry orchards which used to fill this area of Sunnyvale. Although the crust is, of course, very important, I am always careful to use top quality filling. I think that every bit of the filling is important, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few test pies, I discovered the problem with rectangular pie pans is that the crust tends to get over-cooked in the corners. I've concluded that pies just naturally want to be round.&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was the closest unfound cache to my home for most of the time since it was placed. In contrast to the usual situation, I was pretty sure how the coordinates were encoded, but I could not figure out how to extract them. I tried some self-directed activity to get them out, but without luck. Finally today I decided to see if there was someone out there who already had solved the problem I was trying to solve, and sure enough, there was. From there it was a pretty simple exercise to get the coordinates. Since I hadn't any real exercise today, I walked to the cache location and found the cache immediately without a GPSr. However, there was a big piece of trash within inches of it that I thought could bring unwanted attention to it, so I removed that.

I thought the idea of the puzzle was clever, but figuring out how to implement it was cleverer still. My salute to the Lontra cartel.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Simon: Come on out, River. The nice man wants to kidnap you. 

Jubal Early: All right, that's all the hide-and-seek I got time for. I know you're on this ship, little girl, so here's how this goes. You show yourself, we finish this exchange, or your brother's brains will be flying every which-a-way. You understand, I'm sort of on the clock here. It's frustrating. 
River: You're wrong, Early. 
Jubal Early: I'm not wrong, dumpling, I will shoot your brother dead if you don't... 
River: Wrong about River. River's not on the ship. They didn't want her here, but she couldn't make herself to leave. So she melted. Melted away. They didn't know she could do that, but she did. 
Jubal Early: I'm not sure I take your meaning there. 
River: I'm not on the ship. I'm in the ship. I am the ship. 
Simon: River... 
River: River's gone. 
Jubal Early: Then who exactly are we talking to? 
River: You're talking to "Serenity." And Early, "Serenity" is very unhappy. 

Jubal Early: Where'd she go?
Simon: I can't keep track of her when she's not incorporeally possessing a spaceship. Don't look at me.

Jubal Early: You people are all insane.
Simon: Well, my sister's a ship. We had a complicated childhood.

Mal: How come there's some guy on board and you're all of a sudden the ship?
River: I know you have questions.
Mal: That would be why I just asked them.

Mal: Am I dreaming?
River: We all are. Don't make faces.

Jubal Early: You know, with the exception of one deadly and unpredictable midget, this girl is the smallest cargo I've ever had to transport. Yet by far the most troublesome. Does that seem right to you?

Wash: How about his face? Is his face wearing armor?
River: No touching guns!

Jubal Early: I'll be a son of a whore! You're not in my gorram mind! You're in my gorram ship!


River: You're not right, Early. You're not righteous. You got issues. 
Jubal Early: No. Well, yes. I could have that. 

River: I don't belong... dangerous like you. Can't be controlled... can't be trusted. Everyone could just go on without me and not have to worry. People could be who they wanted to be, could be with the people they wanted. Live simple. No secrets. 
Simon: No... 
River: I'll be fine. I'll be your bounty, Jubal Early. And I'll just fade away.   

River: Permission to come aboard? 
Mal: You know, you ain't quite right 
River: It's the popular theory. 
Mal: Go on. Get in there. Give your brother a thrashing for messing up your plan. 
River: He takes so much looking after.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Here's your chance to explore unknown and known places in the Cherry Chase area of Sunnyvale.  Cherry Chase is the name of the local grade school.  It is named after the acres of cherry trees that once stood in this neighborhood.  Even as it was being built in the 60's and earlier, many cherry trees were left in backyards.

Only a few of the orchards remain.  2 areas are along Sunnyvale Saratoga road near the tennis complex, and the other near the Sunnyvale Civic Center.

This trek is about 2 miles from start to end (following streets). How long it will take depends on your route &amp; mode of transportation, and if you are "chirp" enabled.  

Parking is available at the starting location.

Note: Chirps are not "fast". It may take a minute or 2 to be recognized &amp; send its information. Be sure your unit has chirp searching enabled. The range on chirps is about 10-20 feet.  Appreciate your logs on which you find first - chirp or clue cache! (you don't need both to finish)

Please take care when removing &amp; replacing caches. 
No need to open the 3 clue cache containers. PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE CHIRPs or PAPERS! (thanks)

Stage 1 - Wrightmost Corners: This is better known as the Westmoor Village Shopping Center. The start is sorta in the right most corner of the center (trust your GPSr). There is a chirp &amp; clue cache here with information on the next stage.

Stage 2 takes you to, well, a rather unknown site but very important to Sunnyvale. There is a chirp &amp; clue cache here with information on the next stage.

Stage 3 takes you to the only point in Sunnyvale that has had a tornado touchdown! The only sign of the tornado that remains is the broken tree trunk up about 7 feet at this location. The clue cache is not in the tree or plants. There is a chirp &amp; clue cache here with information on the next stage.

Stage 4, the final cache is a MICRO. It is well hidden. No chirp to help you. It is a LOG ONLY micro. Bring your pen.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This multi is relatively close to tu bao bao's daycare, but I was never sure exactly how long it might take.  This morning, though, tu bao bao decided to be an early riser, and we got here much earlier than usual.  So I decided to go check out at least the first stage.  After a short while, I spotted the container, and decided to continue along to stage 2.  Both stage 2 and 3 were rather quick - the longest part was replacing stage 3.  There is a magnet on it, but it is very week, and so I had to figure out the container had been attached when I arrived.  Once I arrived at the final stop, I was amused, but then the hardest search began.  I had had the right idea, but wasn't observant enough for a while.  Finally, I spotted something, and still didn't quite get it until I took a closer look.  Thanks for a fun multi.</groundspeak:text>

Today it was a matter of just completing it.  At one of the stages, there had been a city cleanup day.  There were leftover items with a free sign.  After getting the coordinates, I took a look and scored a few paperback books, a very nice large guinea pig cage and a fold up gate system.  Woohoo.  TFTM, SL</groundspeak:text>

This area looked good for “running up the numbers” because the symbols on the map were fairly dense and I hadn’t really visited the area much before yesterday. By sunset I had pedaled about 28.3 miles and collected twenty-seven smiley faces. Had arranged budget lodging in Sunnyvale. This saved time driving back and forth as well as keeping my carbon footprint down a bit. This was the twelfth of thirty-four smiley faces for today. TNLNSL. I would pedal about 36.61 miles between dawn and dusk today. TFTC! [:)]</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">For the better part of two years this has been my closest to home unfound cache. I must have looked at it dozens of time and spent countless hours researching these books, as I am totally unfamiliar with this material. I make this at least a difficulty 4 puzzle for anyone not in the computer biz. When I first began my research my search engine unfortunately sent me to lots of unrelated places for the different books and only some contained the data points necessary to recognize the theme. I made a wrong choice early on in deciding to use a single source that I thought would have the most thorough and consistent data on these books, but it was missing the essential data. 

At least I can say I got no hints. While having lunch the other day with the puzzling pixies from Palo Alto and jimbexleyspeed they actually laughed at me when I described my frustration with this one! Oh, the shame! This led me to redouble my efforts and this time I decided to explore different sources. Finally a few days ago I noticed something that turned out to be the correct theme, but I found no easy way to derive coordinates. I had the right idea but if I tried to be consistent it didn't work. Either the owner had a reference I didn't find or he was cutting some corners, I think. I never found a source that identified the right way to match the books with what I needed to know. Eventually with enough guesswork and some recollection from college courses or general reading that surprised even me, I came up with enough digits to be pretty sure I was close, but I was unsure of four digits. Fortunately the 1-mile distance limit on this one made one of those digits certain and limited another one to only two choices. This still left 200 possible combinations, so I felt fortunate to get confirmed on my fifth guess.

The hide was a toughie, too. Be sure to bring the location hint as it is necessary. My GPS was sending me all over, too.</groundspeak:text>

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">#6355: Found today after arriving from LAX. I solved this one very quickly as this is right up my alley. Nice job! The hide actually took longer for me than the puzzle. Area was pretty deserted today, middle of a sunny sunday -- these locals should get out more!

Anyway, glad i could solve this one.. the others are tougher, will have to spend some time solving more of your puzzles for my next trip.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">ELVIS LIVES is a nice little anagram.  But do anagrams sometimes reveal more?

Under the More Fun With Anagrams category I notice that certain Geocachers have interesting anagrams, especially when linked with a cache they have placed.

For example:

•Ban Norm might be the cry of the ivy haters.
•Ah Tombs did The Dead over at Alta Mesa Cemetery.
•Threat worries Homeland Security because they 
 cannot solve his puzzles.

I hope this gives someone a cause to grin, maybe add another when you log your find.

Sincerely,
Oh Lard Gut.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="True">This geocache is #9 of 15 in a series that spans around the lower
half of the bay. Each cache in the series contains a sentence to a
story that contains clues to a &lt;a href=
"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC2P94D"&gt;BONUS
16th puzzle cache&lt;/a&gt;. So, for ease of finding the bonus cache,
&lt;b&gt;you should write down all 15 sentences because they are all
required to solve the puzzle cache.&lt;/b&gt;</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">** It's worth noting that each cache in the regular series was
designed to be a quick find with easy access to/from the freeway so
that the adventures cacher could continue on with the series with
minimal downtime! Most of the caches are pretty simple hides, and
you may find muggles to be your greatest challenge. The intent was
to have the series be an adventure that leads to a more exciting
and rewarding bonus puzzle cache. **&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cache Series Background&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I came up with the idea for doing a cache series that spans the
lower half of the bay a few years back, and decided to create this
behemoth series as a surprise birthday present for kobidge in Fall
2009. I set up all 15 caches (and the BONUS puzzler cache) and
joined her as a chauffer and mostly useless accomplice that played
along. We made it through the full series in about 3 hours then
spent a good 30 minutes solving the puzzle to find the secret bonus
cache.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Naturally, this lead to "extra secret" caches within kobidge's
abode, and those ultimately lead to the physical gift. A year and a
half later, we revisited the caches to make sure they were all in
place and had dry logs, and indeed they were all there!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will note that kobidge is still listed as the FTF on all the
cache logs, so consider "Second To Find" the prestige worth aiming
for.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;General Suggestions:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are clues in all kinds of places with this series. There may
be additional information in the sentences at each cache that will
help solve the puzzle, or additional information in the cache pages
themselves. Be vigilant!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Reward/Winners!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One lucky Second To Find cacher will be awarded with a &lt;u&gt;nano
cache&lt;/u&gt; as a prize at the BONUS puzzler cache, so have at
it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
** Congrats to &lt;b&gt;oaknest&lt;/b&gt; on the coveted Second To Find and
first to find after published! **&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
**** Super Extra Congrats to &lt;b&gt;oaknest&lt;/b&gt; for being the first
cacher to complete the regular series and win the prize! ****&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; The entire series can be done in 2-3 hours at the
fastest, and while you can grab them in any order, it is
advantageous to find the caches in order. &lt;b&gt;Don't forget to write
down the full cache sentences!&lt;/b&gt; The Puzzle cache page can also
be solved through other means, but I added many layers of
obfuscation to insure that sane geocachers would have an easier
(and more enjoyable) time finding 15 other caches that lead to a
bonus 16th cache.&lt;br /&gt;

It is a log-only cache located 0.2 miles from the plaque. Enjoy!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;I love a good spy movie, especially one involving codes and
code-breaking. I recently saw the premier of one at a film festival
and got some really neat swag that I decided to share. I can't tell
you the name of the movie; it's a secret. To find out you'll have
to find the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src=
"http://img.geocaching.com/cache/log/4e466814-bd81-4069-b3d4-4ef3afda3cdc.jpg"
width="650" height="330" align="bottom" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This family-friendly cache contains the following at the time of
placement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log Book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stash note&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pencil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mini spy camera key ring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wrench&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japanese dead drop container&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7 movie scene picture cards - some with cryptograms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1930's Dime Kitty savings book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magnifying glass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pre-war nickel and penny&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cipher machine rotor part&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;La Brea Bakery bag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sparkly kid's bracelet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take only one movie scene card per person. You don't need
to trade for those, so they are prizes for the first seven finders.
For the other items please try to trade of equal value and in
theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a camouflaged clear container well-covered with
pine needles. Please re-cover it well. Those of you who have done
my puzzle Dirty Dozen will recognize the location. That cache is
being retired and I thought it appropriate to put another
movie-themed cache in its place. The solution to that puzzle will
be given on that cache page in a note.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p&gt;It's time for our second safety themed geocache series. This
time around the theme is Hand Safety! We can't reach our goal of
ZERO injuries until we eliminate ALL hand injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The physical cache is a nano magnet located adjacent to the
Sunnyvale Water Treatment ponds. Please keep in mind that there is
a healthy gopher snake population in the area, and at times the
bugs are thicker than the stench in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hand Safety cache series was placed with your safety in
mind. If you're looking in the right spot today, you'll have no
need for cut resistant gloves, but a nice pair of leather gloves,
or mechanics gloves will help keep your hands clean and minimize
the chance of abrasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this cache is to familiarize you with cut resistant
glove selection, and to dispel some of the myths about cut
resistant gloves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Beyond Safety workplace at NASA Ames Research Center
we're encouraged to use cut resistant gloves that use the EN 388
rating system because it gives us the cut resistance performance
level information we need when we're making glove selections for
our workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making the right choice can be confusing. Many/most gloves, are
not physically marked with the level of cut protection they
provide. This is often a sign that you've purchased a pair of
gloves with little or no cut resistance protection. In this case
the glove user is forced to make a glove selection without knowing
the true properties of the glove. In the Beyond Safety workplace at
Ames, we aim to do better. All gloves purchased in our workplace
will have either the ANSI or EN 388 (preferable) ratings clearly
marked on the gloves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were to ask a group of people "Which has better cut
resistance, cotton or leather?" The answer is almost unanimously
"leather." But it&amp;rsquo;s actually not the case. Check out the
gallery for the picture entitled "Myths about Cut Resistance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of cut resistant fabrics/materials to choose from
will seem endless when you begin searching for the right pair of
cut resistant gloves. Here are some of the many choices
you&amp;rsquo;ll have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevlar&lt;br /&gt;
Terrycloth&lt;br /&gt;
Spectra Shell&lt;br /&gt;
Spandex&lt;br /&gt;
Patented Foam Nitrile&lt;br /&gt;
Textured Latex&lt;br /&gt;
Flex Tuff&lt;br /&gt;
Dyneema Ninja&lt;br /&gt;
Silicone-free Synthetic Yarn&lt;br /&gt;
Bi-Polymer Coating&lt;br /&gt;
Kevlar &amp;amp; Cotton Blends&lt;br /&gt;
PU Coated Dyneema&lt;br /&gt;
Nylon&lt;br /&gt;
Polyurethane&lt;br /&gt;
Foam Nitrile&lt;br /&gt;
Spectra Cut Resistant Yarn&lt;br /&gt;
Synthetic Blend Fiber&lt;br /&gt;
Dyneema and Lycra Blend&lt;br /&gt;
Hybrid Coating&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so clearly it&amp;rsquo;s not possible for the average worker
(or safety professional) to make a glove selection choice based on
fabric/material type. To eliminate much of the confusion, ensure
that your gloves have been tested in accordance with ANSI or EN 388
standards, and that they have performance level ratings stamped
clearly on the gloves. To learn more about EN 388 I recommend that
you attempt to find the bonus multi-cache of the Hand Safety Series
entitled &amp;ldquo;Hand Safety &amp;ndash; Mechanical Hazards.&amp;rdquo;

I don't recall signing a blank log, and I didn't run into any obvious cachers (nobody carrying a GPSr, for instance), and yet by the end of the day I was seeing both their names in the logs.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">These coordinates take you to the location of another of the many points of historical interest commemorating Palo Alto’s past.  Prior to being annexed to Palo Alto, the town of Mayfield occupied the California Avenue area.  This site commemorates the erection of an institution which fostered one of the foundation attributes of Palo Alto, namely education.  

This area used to be the old town of Mayfield which started when James Otterson opened a wayside inn near the intersection of California Avenue and El Camino Real in 1853.  Also in that year, Elisha Crosby bought 250 acres and named it Mayfield Farm.  The real spur to growth occurred when the railroad station was relocated from Churchill Avenue to the current location on California Avenue in 1863.  During this period, the Palo Alto area consisted of open fields.  In the 1890s Leland Stanford approached the town to provide housing and various retail services for the students and faculty of his new university.  There was one condition however, the saloons must close so that the town would have the appropriate sedate atmosphere.  The town laughed and rejected his proposal, so it became the “watering hole” for Stanford students.  Leland Stanford then hired Timothy Hopkins to purchase property and lay out his own town which he called Palo Alto after the name of his own farm.  Prohibition and general mismanagement caused the town to fall on hard financial times.  As a result, moves started to join Palo Alto.  After a couple of unsuccessful attempts, Mayfield was annexed by Palo Alto in July, 1925.  Little evidence
remains of its colorful existence.

There was a muggle onsite who knew exactly what we were doing and quickly started to tell a story of a woman that he recently saw while on a hiking trip.  She was wearing gloves and "frisking" some bridge out on the trail.  He told us that she was really giving that bridge the what for!  He seemed genuinely happy that we made the find, or maybe he was just thrilled to have his peace and quiet back.  [:D]  Thanks for the fun!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This is a six-stage tour of  public art along Palo Alto's “other” shopping district which, like the University Avenue, is replete with small stores, coffee spots, and restaurants.  It is also close to the Santa Clara North County Court House for those who are lucky enough to be assigned jury duty there.  

This area used to be the old town of Mayfield which started when James Otterson opened a wayside inn near the intersection of California Avenue and El Camino Real in 1853.  Little evidence remains of its existence, however, check out the Herring Box Geocache (GCKPPZ) for one of the few remaining historical markers depicting one of the significant events of the area.  Unfortunately, none of the artworks in this search depict anything of the colorful history of old Mayfield other than the train mural on Birch Street just north of California Avenue. 

The first five stages may be done in any order to collect the required information from which the coordinates of the final stage where the magnetic micro-cache is located can be determined.  The stages are given in order starting from the entry to the shopping area on the Northeast end near the train station and proceeding along the avenue towards El Camino Real.  The end-to-end length is about 0.6 miles and is entirely along California Avenue.  

STAGE 1:   N 37 25.779,  W 122 08.512	
A = Number of people named as collaborating on this mural.

STAGE 2:   N 37 25.652,  W 122 08.630
C = Larger numerical digit in the date of this piece.

STAGE 3:   N 37 25.596,  W 122 08.669
B = The number of letters in the artist’s last name.

STAGE 4:   N 37 25.591,  W 122 08.692
X = Number of human hands shown on this mural.  (Note: Mural is on alley side of bldg).

STAGE 5:   N 37 25.576,  W 122 08.716
Y = The number of ground birds shown on this mural  

STAGE 6 - Cache:   N 37 25.ABC,  W 122 08.DE  where:	
A, B, C are determined individually. 
D = 2X - 1, and E = Y + B + X.

It won't be here after the the new one is placed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The CDC Cyber 170 Series replaced the CDC 6600 and CDC 7600 as the
workhorses of scientific supercomputing. They represented the move
to semiconductor memory and integrated circuits replacing the
previous core memory and electronic components. More details on the
CDC Cyber 170 series can be found at &lt;a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_Cyber"&gt;CDC Cyber Series&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC software development facility here at 1306 Orleans Drive
produced software for these and other models. These were still the
days when large scale operating systems and compilers were still
coded entirely in assembler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cache is a camouflaged bison tube so bring your own pen. As
always, treat the area with care and leave the cache in good shape
for the enjoyment of others. I have seen the odd roving security
patrol car drive through the area on the weekend but they didn't
seem too interested in my presence. The area is likely to be busy
during the work week.&lt;/p&gt;

</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">&lt;p style="border:1px solid #ccc;background-color:#f5f5f5;padding:10px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt; August 2012: Back in 2009 I intentionally hid this cache outside the perimeter of the shopping center, assuming (hoping) that a fence would be erected when renovations begin. That day has come! A new supermarket is coming, along with other changes. The cache is still accessible, but the parking lot is inaccessible, so you'll have to park on one of the nearby residential streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Edgewood Plaza, a slice of Palo Alto history with an uncertain future. This little shopping center was designed by architect A. Quincy Jones and built by Joseph Eichler, creator of the renowned Eichler homes which fill the surrounding neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img.geocaching.com/cache/90272058-add5-4486-a24c-4e5870631e5e.jpg" style="width:400px;height:300px;float:right;border:1px solid #333;margin-left:30px;" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1950s, this shopping center bustled with activity. Today it is nearly a ghost town. Most shops are vacant, including the former Lucky's Supermarket which anchors the site. A few tenants remain: a wig shop. A liquor store. A shop that sells golf gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will become of this once-vibrant spot? Some might wish to tear it down and build a park or some new homes. Others point to its historic pedigree, its unique status as Eichler's only shopping center. Plans to revitalize the site have been stymied for years, but the latest proposal seems to be gaining traction. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

 11. There are no double numbers (i.e. 11, 22, 33, etc) in rows
&lt;font color="#009300" size="4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;B. Use these clues to find
the winning set (straight row, column, or diagonal of five
squares).&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;1. One does not appear in the winning
set.&lt;br&gt;
 2. There are no double numbers in the winning set.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;C. Arrange the winning
set's five numbers in order from smallest to largest. Assign them
letters based on the following:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A=Smallest Number........E=Largest Number&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;Then do some math...&lt;/font&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;F = B-2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;G = The numbers of C reversed (ex.
16=61)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;H = A-3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;I = Ax2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;J = (D+3)/10&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;K = E-1&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The
final cache location is at &lt;font color="#009300" size="4"&gt;N37 F.GH
W122 I.JK&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Trebuchet MS"&gt;The cache is small, but big enough for
a few small trade items.&amp;nbsp; Bring your own
pen/pencil.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I really enjoyed putting this puzzle together.  The cheat sheet was a big help as the directions were a bit ambiguous without it.  Headed out to get the cache this morning before work and was a bit worried with the recent rains that I might not be able to retrieve in my work clothes and shoes.  To my relief, the retrieval was quite easy and I found a nicely stocked cache. Took nothing but did enjoy playing with the toys a bit.  Thanks for the nice puzzle and hide.  This one helped me extend my consecutive caching days to #275 (only 91 more to go!)</groundspeak:text>

&lt;br&gt;
The final coordinates are in a park that is shared by a school and
the public. So I don't recommend going for the cache between 7am
&amp;amp; 4pm on school days.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
P.S. DON'T call what might appear to be phone
numbers!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Update 5/12/04: Upped difficulty to 3 stars based on
feedback.&lt;br&gt;
 Update 7/26/04: Had to move the cache and implement an offset due
to the original cache being muggled. The puzzle remains the same.
Added a half star due to the extra offset exercise.&lt;br&gt;
Update 3/4/06: Cache is once again at solution coordinates and
offset is no longer required. Rating stays the same because now the
cache is a blinker (hidden in plain sight at least.)&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I remember looking at this one, when I first started working puzzles, and having no clue what to do.  I looked at it a few more times since then and was equally clueless.  Then......last night, something clicked and I knew just what to do.  A short time later, I had good coords.  Hopped over there tonight while I was in the area on business and made the quick find. Did my best not to bother Charlotte or any of her kin.  

This one made a nice addition to my consecutive caching run to make it day #353.  Thanks for this and the other POPs.  I am looking forward to solving the last two.</groundspeak:text>

After experiencing a few US caches, my eyes were drawn to an incorrect object. I spent a few minutes looking at a wrong place before I got IT. Very nice "hint". Anyway I would suggest tweezers for next finders, it was very hard to get the logbook out without them. TFTC</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">THE CACHE IS NOT AT THE POSTED COORDINATES, BUT IS WITHIN 3 MILES.

PLEASE NOTE THAT EFFECTIVE 3/1/07 THIS CACHE HAS BEEN RELOCATED TO A NEW AREA. IF YOU COMPLETED THE FORMER VERSION OF THIS PUZZEL, BUT NOT FOUND THE CACHE, YOU ALREADY HAVE THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO SOLVE THIS  VERSION.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">The actual coordinates for the cache are N37 2A.BCD W122 0E.FGH. Letters A through H are represented by the eight phrases or sentences listed below.  
To obtain the coordinates for the cache, you must determine the name of the person who said the particular phrase listed below. Then, determine a 4-digit number for each of the following eight phrases:

(A) "The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here."

(B) "I am not a crook."

(C) "Mr. Watson, come here. I want to see you."

(D) "Energy is equal to mass times the square of the velocity of light."

(E) "I have a dream ...."

(F) "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for
mankind."

(G) "You take the blue pill, the story ends. You take the red pill, you stay in wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes."

(H) "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference."

Now, calculate a 4-digit number for each of the eight passages above.

The checksum for the eight 4-digit numbers is 15,142.

Using the eight 4-digit numbers that you have calculated, select one digit from each number (counting left to right) as follows:
(A) 3rd digit
(B) 3rd digit
(C) 2nd digit
(D) 4th digit
(E) 3rd digit
(F) 4th digit
(G) 3rd digit
(H) 4th digit

Now, for the actual cache coordinates, insert (A) through (H) into N 37 2A.BCD  W122 0E.FGH.

Good luck.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I teach at a German summer and Saturday program and am not soliciting or advertising the program in any way. 

I found out about Geocaching and thought it would be a great activity to do with my students to teach them about maps, GPS, and diversity. When you visit the cache, please leave an object that somehow represents where you are from (location or culture), be it a different state or a different country. If you would like to, but by no means have to, please also, in a word or two, record what area or culture the item represents and what zip code you live in now. That way we can explore some maps of the Bay Area and see where people came from. 

Thanks for participating in our cache!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">I tried looking for this some months ago, but there were too many people around, and it looked like it might be a needle-in-a-haystack, especially without a hint. Today, I was biking around the Bay Trail. My route took me near here, so I thought I'd give it another shot. This time, the hint and maybe the relocation helped a lot. After a bit of a perimeter search, I finally spotted it. I took it to a nearby bench to sign the log. Since these containers aren't always waterproof, I put it in a bag. TFTC. Interesting dog story.</groundspeak:text>

The redeeming quality of this cache is not the cache, but the amazing story of Milo. I've watched him heal and grow this last year and he is quite the intelligent fellow!</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is accessible by public transit and is located in, around, or on a bus stop shelter that services employees for a local virtual machine giant.  You can use the Santa Clara VTA 88 bus line to get to this cache and a couple of other nearby caches. The nearest parking is in company parking lots (filled during working hours but vacant at other times), so park at your own risk or park a little ways away and have a nice walk to the cache (street parking is prohibited near the cache).
 
In honor of the nearby company and to minimize the chance of muggling, the cache container, which has room for only the log, is virtually integrated (no, this isn't a virtual cache) with its surroundings instead of being the typical keyholder cache magnitized to a metal seat. It is not on top of a roof, it is not in any vegetation, it is not a blinker, and you do not need to unscrew anything. Bring a writing instrument, and, if you are looking on a sunny day, bring sunscreen. Have fun.</groundspeak:long_description>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.

There was a time when we relied on mail carriers for all communications, but times have changed. Telephones, TV, jet travel, FedEx and the internet have narrowed the postal contribution and made us less concerned about the weather.  Relive the past by taking up your appointed rounds on a walking tour of mailboxes in the lovely Evergreen Park neighborhood in Palo Alto.  

Take a pencil and paper so you can record the sorts of things a mail carrier should know: pickup times, mailbox ID’s, and other tidbits.  Each waypoint is determined by calculating an offset from the current location using clues as indicated below.  

At the end you will be rewarded with little surprise and a microcache.  It is initially stocked with stamps and a few other trade goods to be delivered to other caches.  

If you are not up for this challenge, don’t go postal, just choose a different career.

Start:
37° 25.731’ N, 122° 08.649’ W.
Let A = the difference in ID numbers between the two westernmost boxes.
Let B = A – the number of mailboxes outside on street.
Obtain new N by subtracting 0.1A from current one.
Obtain new W by adding 0.0B to current one

First stop:
Let C = difference of first digits in each of M-F pickup times.
Let D = product of same two digits.
Obtain new N by adding 0.00C to current one.
Obtain new W by adding 0.D0 to current one.

Second stop:
Let E = First digit of address of location of express mail drop multiplied by last digit of this box ID.
Let F = difference between ID of this mailbox and the ID of the previous one.
Obtain new N by adding 0.E0 to current one.
Obtain new W by adding 0.0F to current one.

Third stop:
Let G = first digit of M-F pickup time.
Let H = G * half of number of eagles on this box.
Obtain new N by adding 0.1GH to current one.
Obtain new W by adding 0.0HG to current one.

Fourth stop:
Let J = last digit of block number on sign across the street.
Let K = first digit of M-F pickup time.
Let L = last digit of M-F pickup time.
Let M = last digit of sum of digits in ID number.
Let N = sum of M-F pickup time digits
Obtain new N by adding 0.JKL to current one.	
Obtain new W by subtracting 0.JMN from current one.

Final stop:
Find your micro cache here!

As an additional challenge, find three Green Relay mailboxes on your way back to start.  I’ve lived around here since the late eighties and have never seen then used.


Note:  Don't mess with the mailboxes.  First, there is no need to. You will only need to read readily available information to complete the cache.  Second, tampering with the mail is a Federal offense.

&lt;p&gt;"Duck Pond? What cache? Mr. Ranger's 1?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No, that's gone. It's That Cache by the Duck Pond!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Maybe - which one is it? 'Goose, Goose, Duck' - that one by Dr.
Doolittle?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No, that's been missing forever. The one I'm talking about is
That Cache by the Duck Pond"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Well, if you want to know, why don't you just tell me the
name?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm telling you - it's That Cache by the Duck Pond!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Huh. Maybe it would help if you just gave me a Waypoint."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's GCK1K6"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ok, just a minute."&lt;br&gt;

Cache owner, please check on and repair/replace this cache as soon as you can. I'll check back in a few weeks, and if I don't see any notes saying the cache has been, or will be, replaced, I may archive the listing.

After the cache is replaced, please enter an "Enable Listing" log to let everyone know they can search for it again.

I want to thank you for the time that you have taken to contribute to geocaching in the past and am looking forward to seeing your cache up and running in the future.

Thanks for your cooperation,

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">The CDC 6400 was a lower cost, lower performance version of the
original 6600. It had unified instruction handling as opposed to
the 6600's ability to execute multiple instructions in parallel.
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_6400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first CDC location in the Bay Area where I worked was here at
3145 Porter Drive. Compiler and OS development was done here. The
location has changed a lot since March of 1969. Compare this
picture from 3/1969 with the current one from 3/2011. The stone
structure housing the signage is about all that looks familiar. The
pines have sure gotten big though.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This completes my CDC cache series. I guess it is fitting that the
first office site shall be last cache created. Hope you enjoy all 6
of them&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cache is a bison tube in a camoed container. Bring a pen. Be
sure to put things back as you found them. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;
Visiting hours are probably best on the weekends because office
windows overlook the cache hide area. On the weekends, no one seems
to be around. It is within 6 feet of the curb and is not an ivy
hide. It is not on the sign and not in any sprinkler heads.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">After listening to Chrysalides and Geo Fan talk about this hide on a recent caching run, I decided to take a look at it. Figured it out right away but was lacking a couple of signs so I wasn't too sure I had it right. I did a search on GE and for some reason I wasn't too comfortable with my answer but went ahead and did a certitude check. I was right, I was wrong....So I ran what I had by Chrysalides and he told me to do just what I had done already. What I figured wasn't ended up being so there you have it.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Fun puzzle! I knew exactly what to do the moment I saw it, but it was harder than I anticipated. I figured out seven of them without the hint, six more with the hint, but then like the other cachers... I got stuck on #13 and #14!  None of my attempts at search engine wizardry brought up any results for those either, so I finally had to just give up and brute force those last two coords using the checksum and Google maps.  Those two letters are probably going to haunt my dreams.

Found the cache today without too much effort... just had to stare a bit. Nice one, TFTH! :)</groundspeak:text>

I could identify only 6 of them (#1,#2,#5,#7,#10 and #15) myself, and that was not good enough to sort of brute force the rest. She added #3 and #8 besides the duplicated ones. That was more than enough to do the rest. [;)]

There is a place where the sidewalk ends
And before the street begins,
And there the grass grows soft and white,
And there the sun burns crimson bright,
And there the moon-bird rests from his flight
To cool in the peppermint wind.

Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
And the dark street winds and bends.
Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And watch where the chalk-white arrows go
To the place where the sidewalk ends.

Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
For the children, they mark, and the children, they know
The place where the sidewalk ends.

-Shel Silverstein


I have been to this place, “Where The Sidewalk Ends”, but it does not seem as nice as Shel Silverstein’s poem, but you can find a cache here!
You can only approach this sidewalk from the west. There is legal parking at (N37 24.184 W 122 00.775) which is Karlstad Drive. Then a little walk to the east. The cache is a magnetic key holder with a log and pencil. There is a little bit of room for small geocoins and such.
